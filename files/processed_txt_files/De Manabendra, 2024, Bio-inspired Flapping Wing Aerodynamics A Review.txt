sudhakar2 srinidhi gadde3 deepthi shanmugam4 and s vengadesan5 abstract the design of micro aerial vehicles has been long inspired by biological flyers such as birds and insects the aerodynamic principles of flapping wing flights are complex due to the rapid wing motion and the inherent complex vortex dynamics several experimental and numer ical investigations have been carried out in the past decades to uncover the mechanisms responsible for the improved aerodynamic capability of flapping wings this paper provides an overview of the aerodynamics of flapping insect wings after providing a brief overview of the aerodynam ics of a single wing we discuss how the vortex dynamics are altered in the case of tandem wings a significant challenge to designing a stable mav is the environmental effects stemming from the gust and ground presence in this paper we present how the force generation is altered due to such effects moreover we point out unsolved research questions on insect flight whose answers could greatly help to improve the design of flapping wing mavs keywords delayed stall rotational circulation wake capture tandem wing gust effect ground effect immersed boundary method 1 introduction natural flights that we see around us are the results of millions of years evolution for survival of the species whether it is biolocomotion like the gliding flight of an eagle at an altitude of about 2 km above ground level agl1 and hoveringa flights of dragonfly at ground level or passive transport of seed dispersion through various modes like parachuting gliding and helicoptering the living species have efficiently used the laws of physics structural dynamics and material science to survive the unique kinematics of the flapping wings whether it be the famous figure of eight2 or the clap and fling3 mechanism reveal the marvel of nature to utilize the fundamentals of unsteady a it is a mode of flight in which the lift produced by the wings exactly balances the weight of the insect and the thrust force equalizes the drag as a result the insect remains stationary in air aerodynamics for remaining air borne fascinated with these miracles around us human beings have been studying these natural phenomenon and applying them to realise bionic solutions for the problems we encounter in our daily lives this branch of engineering is often referred to as bionic engineering or biomimicry which dates back to the time when leonardo da vinci 1452 1519 studied the anatomy of birds to find the right design of a flying machine one such area of research under the aegis of bionic engineering is the study of unsteady aerodynamics in the vicinity of the flapping wings insects beat their wings at a much higher frequency than birds the frequency of wing flapping inversely scales with the size of the insect in each cycle an insects typical wing motion can be divided into four portions as shown in fig 1 during the translational phases the wing accelerates and decelerates through the air at an almost constant angle of attack these phases are j indian inst sci vol 1041 181203 january 2024 journaliiscernetin 13 1 systems engineering division

c watertreading modeellipse represents an idealized wing cross section the kinematics presented are for hovering flight and denote the angle of attack and the stroke plane angle respectively am is the stroke length denoted as downstroke and upstroke in the figure during both of these halfstrokes the wing must be in a positive angle of attack to generate weightsupporting lift force insects achieve this by rotating their wings rapidly at either end of the translational phases the rotational phase during the transition from the downstroke to the upstroke is called supination and the other is called pronation different species of insects employ different wing kinematics however the wing motion employed by a variety of wings can be well approximated by their movement along a horizontal stroke planeb fig 1a or an inclined stroke plane fig 1b in the horizontal stroke plane motion also called as the normal mode the wings move along the horizontal stroke plane both downstroke and upstroke produce positive lift such a wing motion is observed in many insects including fruitflies bees and beetles other insects like dragonflies and hoverflies move their wings along an inclined plane where the downstroke and upstroke produce positive and negative vertical force respectively hence the angle of attack during the upstroke is kept minimal so as to reduce the negative lift generated another b it is the plane along which the insect flaps its wings in reality the flapping wing exhibits complex motion like the figureofeight however it is a standard assumption to confine its movement along a plane as shown in figure 1 182 13 kinematics was experimented by freymuth4 is the water treading mode it is shown in fig 1c where the airfoil is horizontal at the end of the stroke it resembles the fish ventral fins that are used to maintain the position in still water although this has not been observed in actual insects this concept is believed to be relevant for designing mavs the fluid dynamics of flapping wings are reviewed in earlier w orks57 the existing reviews are mainly concerned with the unsteady aerodynamics of a single flapping wing in undisturbed conditions in the present review article we briefly touch upon the above point the main focus is on the effect of wingwing interaction associated with tandem wings in addition we focus on the effect of gust and the ground effect that was not covered in earlier reviews on insect flightthe present review article attempts to compile the research carried out in india and across the globe and give a roadmap for future studies that can be taken up by the research community the wings of an insect are in general flexible and may exhibit deformation owing to the fluidinduced loads acting on them there are several studies that investigated the influence of such coupled fluidstructure interaction effects on the flapping wing aerodynamics for a comprehensive summary of such studies readers can consult other review articles68 in this paper we review only studies focused on rigidwings and we emphasize the gust and ground effects j indian inst sci vol 1041 181203 january 2024 journaliiscernetin bioinspired flapping wing aerodynamics a review the rest of the article is structured as follows in sect 2 research on the unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms governing the flight of the flapping wing like delayed stall rotational circulation wake capture dipole jetsc and other unsteady aerodynamic principles are covered in sect 3 research associated with studying the unsteady aerodynamics governing the flow past tandem wing have been discussed the natural flyers operate in external harsh environments in sect 4 a brief summary of the work reporting the effect of external environmental conditions like gust and ground effect have been described section 5 touches upon the application of advanced computational approaches like dynamic meshing technique immersed boundary method and lattice boltzmann method to simulate the complex flow physics in the vicinity of moving boundaries we also briefly cover the associated postprocessing techniques in sec 6 the article concludes with closure remarks indicating the different possible research directions which could be pursued by the researchers to enhance the present knowledgebase in this area 2 unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms singleflapping wing the lift force on fixed or rotarywing machines flying at large reynolds numbers re viz aeroplanes and helicopters can be quantified using conventional aerodynamic theories with reasonable accuracy the initial attempts to understand the aerodynamics of flapping wings relied on applying these traditional theories and hence the assumption of attached quasisteady flow911 as the name implies the assumption eliminates unsteady effects it presumes that on the flapping wing the instantaneous forces are equivalent to that on the fixed wing at the same velocity and angle of attack applying such theories has led to the wellknown bumblebee paradox12 that persisted for decades in his classical work ellington13 has comprehensively addressed whether the quasisteady aerodynamic principles are applicable for flapping insect flight his investigation was centred on proof by contradiction and concluded that conventional theories could not explain the c dipole jet has been identified in the inclined stroke plane flapping as the jet of air produced in between the counter rotating vortex produced during each flapping cycle the series of vortices created through several cycles forms a jet underneath the wing which aids to the lift production aerodynamics of hovering insects moreover he emphasized that unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms play a crucial role in flapping wings at low to moderate re physical experiments conducted on tethered freelyflying live insects and their dynamically scaled robotic counterparts and highfidelity numerical simulations have helped researchers to understand better the complex interaction between the rapidly oscillating insect wings and the surrounding viscous fluid while accurate techniques for force measurements delicate flow visualisation methods and improvements in highspeed videography have aided the physical experiments the rapid surge of highperformance computing hardware and development of accurate numerical methods to account for the moving boundaries have largely aided reliable computational studies on insect flight these studies have uncovered several unsteady mechanisms responsible for the enhanced aerodynamic performance of flapping wings this section describes the three most important mechanisms namely delayed stall rotational circulation and wake capture they act on several insect species we briefly touch upon other recently identified mechanisms in mosquitoes that sweep their wings at a frequency of the order of 1000 hz this review does not cover mechanisms like clap and fling31415 that is specific to some insects 21 delayed stall a fixedwing translating through a fluid stalls when the angle of attack aoa exceeds approximately 12 the boundary layer separates from the top surface leading to the famous vonkarman vortex shedding and the loss of lift in contrast despite many insects operating their wings at an aoa over 45 the stalling does not occur instead the wing of an insect supports a stable leading edge vortex lev a mechanism known as delayed s tall1620 owing to such a large aoa the shear layer separates from the leading edge and it gets reattached over the top surface the separation and the subsequent reattachment generates a large vortex called the lev the lev creates a lowpressure region or suction zone over the wings top surface this leads to an increased pressure difference between the top and bottom surface of the wing and thus the lift force is enhanced alternatively it can be explained that 183 j indian inst sci vol 1041 181203 january 2024 journaliiscernetin 13 m d manabendra et al the lev integrates its circulationd to the bound circulation around the wing leading to improved lift dickinson and gotz21 conducted experiments on scaled 2d translating wings to understand the delayed stall mechanism levs are observed in their studies in the re of 75225 they shed from the wing after 23 chord length of travel and cause vonkarman vortex shedding this confirmed that the stability of the lev is related to threedimensional aspects of the flow field experiments conducted on a tethered hawkmoth manduca sexta and on its scaled mechanical model produced strong evidence of the presence of an attached lev16 the vortex was intense enough to explain the large weightsupporting force created by the flapping wings the translational phase of the wing motion not the rotational phase was responsible for the generation of lev unlike 2d wings the lev was attached for the whole duration of the stroke the axial flow through the vortex core the spanwise flow over the wing was primarily responsible for the stability of the vortex as shown in fig 2 it was observed that the magnitude of the axial flow was comparable to the mean flapping velocity of the wing the structure of the lev with the presence of a strong spanwise flow was similar to the conical lev developed on delta wings liu et al22 performed cfd simulations of hawkmoth hovering provided additional details on the structure of lev and predicted unsteady forces acting on its flapping wings birch and d ickinson18 to investigate the source of levs stability conducted experiments on a dynamically scaled model of fruitfly that flies at a low re compared to hawkmoth at such a small re the magnitude of spanwise flow through the vortex core was insignificant it was confirmed that the difference in flow features is due to re and not due to the difference in the experimental setup moreover mitigating the spanwise flow by fences and edge baffles did not lead to the detachment of lev they hypothesized the following for prolonged attachment of lev downwash induced by the tip vortex and wake vorticity reduced the aerodynamic aoa and controlled the vorticity growth in order to shed more light on the effect of re on the structure of the lev shyy and liu20 performed numerical simulations over flapping d it is defined as the line integral of velocity around a closed contour and is an important quantity in aerodynamics the closed contour chosen always encloses the wing larger the circulation around the wing the larger the lift force generated 184 13 figure 2 schematic of the conical lev over a hawkmoth wing wings at different re the downwash hypothesis proposed in18 was questioned by these authors this was due to the fact that the downwash reduced the lift production on hawkmoth and fruitfly by 14 and 22 respectively it was argued that these differences were small to confirm the effect of downwash as the stabilising mechanism lentink and d ickinson23 performed force measurements and flow visualization on revolving wings over a range of re to provide fundamental insights into the stability of lev they expressed the navierstokes equations on a rotating frame of reference attached to the wings surface their study concluded that centripetal and coriolis accelerations act to stabilize the lev notably the physical mechanism responsible for stabilizing the lev was observed to be independent of the re range 10014000 considered in that study the delayed stall is the most essential unsteady mechanism responsible for the elevated aerodynamic performance of flapping insect wings existing studies confirm that the additional circulation induced by the lev makes 6070 contribution to the strokeaveraged lift coefficient2425 the use of levs for lift enhancement is not limited to insects alone levs are found to play a critical role in some animals and autorotating seeds also a few of them are listed below usherwood and e llington26 conducted flow visualisation studies on revolving model wings on different insect species mayfly to quail in the re range of 6000 to 15000 levs were present in this entire re range and over different biologically relevant wing planforms water tunnel measurements over the wing shapes of common swift apus apus revealed the presence of a prominent stable conical lev over the handwing27 the tests were j indian inst sci vol 1041 181203 january 2024 journaliiscernetin bioinspired flapping wing aerodynamics a review conducted over the re range of 375037500 and at aoa between 5 and 10 these values are relevant for the gliding flight of swifts the strength of lev increased with re while its size remains unaffected at the aoa of 10 this led to the conclusion that the flowfield associated with the armwing was attached but the handwing experienced a separated flow and a stable lev it was postulated that the swift and other birds use the higher lift and drag generated due to the lev for enhanced flight agility muijres et al28 conducted digital particle image velocimetry measurements of freely flying small nectarfeeding bats glossophaga soricina in a low turbulence wind tunnel bats were performing slow forward flight with re 5000 and the effective aoa of 51 19 a stable lev and an attached laminar flow in the trailing edge were observed over their wings and as a result the effective lift coefficient was larger than that predicted by the quasisteady theory the flow visualisation also reported a possible role of rotational circulation the sharp leading edge of bats wings contributed to the generation of lev while active modulation of wing shape and camber influenced the stability and control of lev not only living animals also the autorotating seeds utilize levs to remain aloft for a longer time29 such seeds generate a stable lev to achieve improved aerodynamic performance moreover analogous to hawkmoth wings16 a strong spanwise flow was observed that drained the vorticity and stabilized the lev in addition to the studies mentioned above the delayed stall is found on hovering hummingbirds30 and b utterflies19 for a detailed review of different aspects of lev readers can refer to the article by eldredge and jones31 22 rotational circulation as explained in the introduction insect wings kinematics in each cycle involve translational and rotational phases the delayed stall explains enhanced lift force during the translational part of the wing stroke it was postulated that the rotational portion of the wing stroke also should contribute to the lift enhancement dickinson et al17 estimated that in their experiments mimicking drosophila wing kinematics the rotational motion contributed approximately 35 of the total weight supporting force to obtain such an estimate they subtracted the lift contribution in the translational phase from the total lift the levs contribution in the former was obtained by moving the wing to a 180 arc as shown in fig 3 the rotational contribution is clearly visible from two peaks appearing in each halfstroke denoted by a white dot and a cross in the figure each of these peaks corresponds to a different unsteady rotational aerodynamic mechanism explained in the present and the next subsection to generate upward lift in each halfstroke insects must appropriately adjust the wings angle of attack between the strokes this is achieved by a rapid wing rotation about its spanwise axis an unsteady mechanism directly associated with this fast rotation is the rotational circulation17 the quick change in the angle of attack leads to the additional generation of circulation around the wing which results in enhanced lift force during the stroke reversal an analogy was drawn between the rotational circulation and the magnus effect in order to confirm this analogy the phase between the translational and rotational motion was analysed by dickinson et al17 the advanced and delayed rotation of the wing with respect to the translation resulted in respectively positive and negative peaks in the lift curve which reassured the proposed analogy with the magnus effect to provide additional evidence that the peaks in the rotational lift are due to the rapid change in the angle of attack they showed that the movement of the rotational axis towards the leading edge gave rise to a monotonic increase in the respective peak this is consistent with the kutta condition that predicts the appropriate amount of circulation around the wing so that the flow leaves smoothly at the trailing edge an alternate view of the rotational circulation was presented by walker32 who developed an unsteady blade element model to investigate whether the force peak in the rotation is due to the magnus effect based on the comparison between the model and the experimental results the author postulated that rotational circulation could be explained by the same mechanism operating during the translational phase of the wing 23 wake capture as shown in fig 3 two force peaks are associated with rotational phases appearing in the time history of aerodynamic forces of a hovering insect these peaks are denoted with a white dot and a cross in the figure while the cross represented the rotational circulation the white dots were to be caused by a different mechanism this was 185 j indian inst sci vol

lift due to wing rotation open circles and crosses in the bottom plot mark the contributions of wake cap ture and the rotational circulation respectively data from dickinson et al17 digitally extracted and redrawn because the timing of the force peaks associated with white dots were not influenced by the nature of wing rotation dickinson et al17 attributed these peaks to wake capture a mechanism by which insects interact with the wake generated from the previous stroke to augment the aerodynamic forces vortices shed into the wake act to push the fluid towards the wing and thereby increase the relative velocity of the wing with respect to the surrounding fluid when an insect performs advanced rotation the wings pass through the augmented fluid velocity at a positive angle of attack fig 4 and thereby produce a positive force peak as shown in fig 3 for a symmetric rotation the wing intercepts the wake at an angle of 90 and produces no lift the negative angle of attack of delayed rotation leads to a negative force peak as discussed in17 further investigations3335 revealed that the force peak discussed above was a combination of wake capture and added mass however the contribution from the wake capture is found to be more significant than that of the added mass while the development of quasisteady models is attempted for rotational circulation with a reasonable success3236 it cannot predict the wake c apture34 as the wake capture is a truly unsteady mechanism lua et al37 investigated the influence of acceleration and deceleration of the wing on the effectiveness of wake capture it is found that while the acceleration duration did not significantly affect the force enhancement the duration of deceleration produced a noticeable effect larger deceleration phase reduced the strength of the vortex and also led to vorticity transport away from the wing as a result of these two features the wingwake interaction force was significantly reduced the study considered only advanced wing rotation and the above conclusion was valid for re of 160 and 4000 in a recent study lin et al38 based on their combined experimental and numerical investigations proved the beneficial use of wake capture in the forward flight of butterflies they have presented a surprising result small amplitude wing pitch led to an enhanced wake capture while larger pitching angle resulted in the attenuation of this unsteady phenomenon this is due to the fact that for small amplitude pitching the vortex shed into the wake in the previous halfstroke induces fluid velocity towards the wing and vice versa it was quantified that the wake capture contributed to a significant 47 of the thrust generation rotational circulation and wake capture are the mechanisms that operate at the time of stroke reversal during which the insect rapidly changes the wings angle of attack they make a noticeable contribution to insects exhibiting large stroke amplitude the relative importance of these mechanisms becomes more significant for insects that use short amplitude highfrequency wing kinematics this was briefly demonstrated for kinematics of hoverflies by dickinson et al17 additional confirmations were provided to this conclusion in an extensive study by atlshuler et al39 they captured the wing kinematics of honeybees with stroke amplitude 90 figure 4 illustration of wake capture mechanism for advanced rotation 186 13 j indian inst sci vol 1041 181203 january 2024 journaliiscernetin bioinspired flapping wing aerodynamics a review replicated them in their experimental study and measured the aerodynamic forces this study confirmed that the mechanisms during stroke reversal become prominent with a reduction in stroke amplitude the wakecapture mechanism has also been demonstrated to enhance the aerodynamic forces in clapandfling wing k inematics4041 this suggests that the mechanism is effective in augmenting force generation in other kinematic patterns associated with insect flight 24 dipole jet in every flapping cycle the fully grown lev is shed along with previously created tev forming a vortex pair this counterrotating vortex pair vortex dipole generated during each cycle is shed into the wake the vortex dipole has a jet and an induced velocity in between them the downward movement of this jet and the associated momentum add to the vertical force of the flapping wing this vertical velocity underneath the flapping wing was reported to be high4244 this was utilised to understand the changes in the vertical force45 figure 5 gives the schematic diagram showing the dipole jet velocity in between the dipole pair of current flapping cycle in this work the change in stroke plane angle was shown to modify the characteristics of the dipole jet such as its velocity magnitude direction and spread which affected the vertical force hence the dipole jet is an important factor affecting the lift enhancement of the flapping wing and it is discussed here unlike other mechanisms described in the earlier subsections which occur at specific figure 5 schematic diagram of dipole jet instances during the flapping cycle the dipole jet velocity is present throughout a cycle the averaged force trend can be analysed using the dipole jet properties as will be explained in section 42 25 other mechanisms most insects exhibit a large stroke amplitude more than 120 but mosquitoes wing kinematics involves relatively smaller amplitude 45 moreover they have high aspect ratio ar wings and their wing beat frequency is as large as 800 hz researchers proposed that due to such peculiar reduction in stroke amplitude mosquitoes may use a different aerodynamic mechanism4647 bomphrey et al46 postulated and demonstrated that mosquitoes rely on rotational phases at either end of the of wing stroke for weight support in contrast to the translation part the contribution of the lev to lift enhancement is less significant for mosquitoes when compared to other animals and the numerical investigations show the presence of two mechanisms 1 rotational drag as explained in4849 and 2 trailing edge vortex tev wake capture mechanism the latter effect fundamentally differs from the wake capture described earlier17 the wake generated from the previous halfstroke interacts with the wing and resulted in the formation of a large coherent vortex bound to the trailing edge this induces a large suction on the trailing portion of the wing and generates a corresponding peak in lift force additional careful simulations prove that when the amplitude of oscillation is artificially increased the contribution of the translational mechanism takes over another study47 that performed numerical simulations over experimentally measured kinematics of mosquito wings presented contrasting conclusions compared to the study of bomphrey et al46 liu et al47 computed the added mass effect as well as the difference between aerodynamic forces generated in the first and fourth cycles based on these data they concluded that 1 the added mass is responsible for the first force peak in a halfstroke 2 the wake capture contrary to that reported in46 is detrimental moreover during the midportion of the down upstroke the aoa varied rapidly from 16 to 46 they attributed the peak in aerodynamic forces in the midhalf stroke to this rapid wing rotation and argued that the wing has not travelled sufficiently enough for the lev to form and thus no role to play 187 j indian inst sci vol 1041 181203 january 2024 journaliiscernetin 13 m d manabendra et al an important question relevant for the flapping wing is the following does the tip vortex generated due to the 3d nature of the flowfield enhance or adversely affect the aerodynamic forces tip vortices always reduce lift on fixed wings in contrast shyy et al50 reported an increase in cl on flapping wings due to the tip vortex at re 1000 flapping wings of ar 2 4 and 6 are considered in a numerical study aimed to investigate 3d effects51 they concluded that both cl and cd increase and the wingwake interaction reduces with reduction in ar carr et al52 investigated 3d wings of ar from 1 to 4 the force measurements and flow visualisation led to the conclusion that the lift coefficient is the same on wings of ar 2 and 4 however the combined vortical structures generated due to lev tev and tip vortices are significantly different in summary detailed studies are required to fully understand the interaction of the tip vortex and lev on flapping wings 3 unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms tandem flapping wings insects such as flies and mosquitoes belong to the order diptera53 and have only one pair of wings in contrast some of the most common insects such as grasshoppers bees and dragonflies have two pairs of wings in tandem the unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms for a single wing were discussed in the previous section the present section details the aerodynamics of tandem wings the presence of wings in tandem gives rise to further intricacies in the aerodynamics due to the interaction between the forewing and the hindwing analysis of the dragonfly aeschna juncea flight with quasisteady theory has showed that lift obtained through quasisteady theory is not large enough to support the dragonfly flight54 this indicates that the unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms play a vital role in the dragonfly flight or in the other flyers with tandem wings while insects like bees and wasps have mechanically coupled fore and hindwings dragonflies have wings that operate independently of each other figure 6 presents a schematic representation of the major difference between single and tandem flapping wing aerodynamics for fliers with only one pair of wings fig 6a the aerodynamics does not involve any wake interaction as there is no wing in the wake of the vortices shed by the wing however in the presence of tandem wings fig 6b c multiple interesting scenarios arise with the wing phasing and interwing distance resulting in wingwing and wingwake interactions while multitude of phase relationships are possible in the presence of two pairs of wings here we focus on inphase and outofphase two phasing frequently employed by dragonfly the wings are said to be flapping inphase when both forewing and hindwing perform the upstroke or downstroke simulataneously however the wings are said to flap outofphase when the forewing is in upstroke hindwing is in its downstroke of the cycle and vice versa the distance between the wings aid or deter the growth of the levs of the hindwing when the wings are flapping inphase lev of the hindwing is enhanced due to the tev of the forewing56 during the downstroke when the lift is produced the trailing edge of the forewing produces a counter clockwise tev which interacts with the leading edge of the hindwing giving rise to an enhanced lev in the hindwing however this enhancement depends on the interwing distance with lev enhancement observed when the interwing distance is less than one chord length at larger distances the lev enhancement of the figure 6 schematic of vortex dynamics for a single wing b tandem wings flapping inphase and c tan dem wings flapping outofphase giving rise to wingwing and wingvortex interactions 188 13 j indian inst sci vol 1041 181203 january 2024 journaliiscernetin bioinspired flapping wing aerodynamics a review hindwing due to the forewing is negligible56 when the wings flap outofphase the hindwing passes through the vortex shed by the forewing and the distance between the wings are crucial for the lift generation during counterstroking at small interwing distances the hindwing passes through the shed vortex of the forewing before the stroke reversal which reinforces the lev generation however at larger interwing distance this effect is negligible increased levs at lower interwing distances increases the suction at the top of the hindwing when compared to a single wing increasing the lift generation56 to understand the lift generation with tandem wings due to the vortex interaction discussed previously we present the lift coefficients of the forewing and hindwing during inphase and outofphase stroking in fig 7 from hsieh et al55 figure 7a b show that when the wings flap inphase most of the lift is generated during the downstroke and though there are differences both fore and hindwing generate lift during downstroke indicating a higher overall lift generation when compared to a single flapping wing however in counterstroking when the forewing is in downstroke and generate lift fig 7c the hindwing is in its upstroke and does not generate any lift but when the forewing is in its upstroke and not generating any lift the hindwing generates lift fig 7d balancing the lift force generation over the cycle this gives rise to constant average lift force over a cycle which results in more stability as the force on the body remains relatively constant in this way the change in wing phasing with tandem wings is reported to lead to an increase in thrust production during inphase and readiness for manoeuverability and hunting performance during outofphase s troking57 force and power analysis of the tandem wing flight by broering et al58 shows that the wingphasing adopted by tandem fliers allows them to change the flight mode at 0 degree phase lag the tandem fliers produce high thrust at higher propulsive efficiency ratio of aerodynamic power output for propulsion to the power input59 but lower lift efficiency ratio of aerodynamic power for lift to the power input59 switching to counterstroking motion though results in decreasing thrust production increases the lift efficiency resulting in an overall stable force production therefore while the former motion is suitable for highperformance maneuvers the latter is suitable for cruising flight or hovering apart from just the wingphasing the presence of ground also affects the lift production in the presence of tandem wings specifically a persistent rebound vortex is observed in the presence of tandem wings which modify the effective angle of attack of the wings affecting the lift production60 while the vortex analysis presented before are mostly based on simulations experimental observation of the motion of tethered dragonfly also shows that the aerodynamic force and power of a dragonfly is function of the phase wang and russell61 report that inphase stroke is used for acceleration and outofphase motion that require minimal power to generate weight balancing force is used for steady hovering not only tethered dragonfly measurements but tandem flapping wing model ornithopter configuration measurements in a windtunnel carried out by warkentin and d elaurier62 show that phase angles of 050 is ideal for thrust generation producing better propulsive efficiencies this agrees both with the tethered dragonfly observations and simulations most studies of tandem wing aerodynamics focus on simplified representations of the wing however recent simulations with corrugated wings of d ragonfly63 show that the vortices trapped within the corrugations further enhance the lift production while the flat plate or elliptical cross section provide better propulsive efficiency and acceleration furthermore most analysis of the dragonfly aerodynamics include rigid wings while in reality the wings of the dragonfly are flexible simulations of tandem wing including the flexibility show that the spanwise bending deformation aids in keeping the lev attached to the wing in both hovering and forward flights this deformation also contributes to the horizontal force64 while there has been significant progress in understanding the unsteady aerodynamics of flapping flight there are open questions regarding the way body of dragonfly affects the lift generation and aids or deters the vortex evolution future simulations and measurements could focus on performing a full 3d simulation of dragonfly with a coupled fluid structure interaction including the body 4 environmentalexternal factors while the previous sections reported the studies of flapping wings exposed to ideal inflow conditions the real world conditions consist of atmospheric disturbances the aerodynamics of a flapping wing under a smooth fluid environment is different from that in a disturbed condition which the insect experiences in outdoors to 189 j indian inst sci vol 1041 181203 january 2024 journaliiscernetin 13 m d

aspect researchers have studied the performance of flapping wing systems in different environmental conditions by considering various external factors this section gives a brief technical narration of these research works specifically this section covers studies on guste effect and ground effects 41 gust effect ornithopters and entomopters have always faced stability issues during their flights in the gusty outdoor environment limited studies reporting the aerodynamics of flapping wings under gusty conditions are available to understand the research trend in study of flapping wing systems under the influence of gust an elementary bibliometric analysis was carried out scopus database for the period spanning from 1966 to 2023 was used the search was carried out based on e gust is a transient fluid dynamic disturbance caused by sudden change in relative air velocity a few reasons for the generation of gust are turbulence wind shear or solar heating and cooling near the ground and flow past any natural or anthropogenic obstacles 190 13 keywords with primary search strings of flapping wing and gust later scopus data analytics was used to retrieve the yearwise publications of papers and a cumulative graph of the publications was plotted fig 8 the research papers reported both numerical simulations and experimental work it is observed that studies on the effect of gusts on flapping wing aerodynamics were less till 2006 a steep rise in publications is observed from 2007 onward from countrywise distribution of the documented research work on flapping wings subjected to gust us leads

accounting for these literature are china japan and india in this section we shall report a few of the notable works focusing on the aspects related to flapping wings subjected to gust watkins et al65

detrimental effect induced by gusts on flapping wings and inferred that the gust resulted in aerial vehicles crash lian68 numerically investigated the effect of a gusty environment on flapping foil using a 2d algebraic moving grid approach the studies revealed that certain kinematics alleviated the freestream gust fluctuation and ensured stable flight however they could not identify a specific single parameter which reduced the gust effect individually assessment of the effect of a frontal gust on forward flapping flight of a rigid wing in 3d reference frame was carried out by viswanath and tafti69 using an inhouse les code with a subgrid stress model from their studies they inferred that the leadingedge vortex structures and consequently the instantaneous vertical and horizontal forces were altered by the apparent angle of attack 2d numerical investigation of the flight dynamics of motionless and flapping wings in single and tandem configurations was carried out by prater and lian70 under sinusoidal velocity inflow conditions they reported that for wings flapping in tandem configuration the stationary hindwing enhanced the gust insensitivity and augmented vertical force produced by the wing pure and sinusoidal hovering asymmetric flight in 2d frame with zero mean gusts were studied by sarkar et al71 using a lagrangian particlebased algorithm they inferred from their studies that mean lift forces improved with a rise in fluctuation gust amplitude however the normalized power increased marginally with the aerodynamic loading 2d numerical investigation of the fluid dynamics of a variable camber airfoil with plunging motion under gusty conditions was studied by zhu et al72 they reported that variable camber aerofoils mitigated the adverse load on flapping foil under gust their studies also showed that specific camber shapes could resist the change in the force pattern by gust within a definite band of frequency or gust amplitude effect of lateral downward and frontal gusts on forces generated by the horizontally flapping wing in 3d frame were studied by jones and yamaleev73 they reported that the aerodynamics of insectscale wings depended on the relative orientation of the wings stroke plane and the apparent gust 2d numerical simulation of a semiactivated flapping foil in gusty flow was carried out by chen et al74 for power extraction application using ansys fluent they inferred from their studies that the power extraction efficiency ratio of actual power extracted by a flapping foil to the theoretical kinetic power available in the fluid stream increased with gust fluctuation amplitude for a specific pair of pitching amplitude and frequency moreover the power extraction efficiency enhanced for a 180 phase difference between pitching and gust this observation was attributed to the generation of high lift force das and tiwari75 numerically investigated plunging aerofoils in the presence of wind gusts they reported the effect of nondimensional parameters like the amplitude and frequency of plunging motion and gust amplitude on the force patterns they inferred from their studies that the wake pattern was strongly influenced by the gust frequency in addition at a constant amplitude of plunging when the reduced frequency is increased the horizontal force changed from drag to thrust 2d and 3d studies reported thus far aimed at studying force patterns produced by the flapping wings in single and tandem configurations under oscillatory gusty inflow conditions with different kinematics and camber the gust model used for these studies were predominantly varying with time76 few of these inflow conditions are shown in fig 9 here uo is minimum or average gust 191 j indian inst sci vol 1041 181203 january 2024 journaliiscernetin 13 m d manabendra et al velocity u1 is maximum gust velocity dc is the duty cycle and f is the gust frequency wind shear or spatial variation in the inflow velocity was neglected in these studies bioinspired or regular geometric shapes like rectangle were typically used as wing planform shape for these studies however how different wing shapes respond to gusty inflow had remained unexplored in this context a series of numerical studies on the effect of spatiotemporally varying gusty conditions on flapping wings in 2d and 3d were carried out by de et al7783 these studies focused on understanding the onset of instabilities in the force patterns generated by flapping wings subjected to spatiotemporally varying gust under this set of studies gust sensitivity of wing with different planform shapes were also studied for qualifying and quantifying the detrimental effects of gust various statistical techniques were used having understood the effects of gust on flapping wings performance researchers have also attempted to study the mitigation strategies that can be adopted to attenuate the destabilising effects of gust girguis et al84 experimentally studied the unsteady loading experienced by a flapping wing system when subjected to a transverse gust after understanding how the momentum altered before and after the gust interacts with the flapping wings they postulated that liftmitigating manoeuvres helped to reduce the momentum deficit and attenuate the disturbances caused by gust in yet another recent study by zhuoer et al85 experimental and numerical evaluations showed that by engineering the spanwise morphing of the flapping wings in a specific manner ie by dynamically varying the morphing frequency morphing length and the twist gust effects can be effectively alleviated while the studies reported in this section focused to understand the flapping wing systems behaviour in gusty environmental conditions and strategies to mitigate the detrimental effects of gust there still exist few gaps in the knowledge base wing flexibility can be introduced and effect of gust on the forces produced by the flexible flapping wing can be studied through coupled fluid structure interaction simulations apart from the frontal gust effect of lateral and longitudinal gust with phase difference between the flapping cycle and gust cycle on the flexible wings in single and tandem configuration can be studied on flapping kinematics front simulation of wings subjected to gust and with different flapping patterns like inclined stroke plane or figure 192 13 of eight can help to understand the bionic phenomenon more rigorously 42 ground effect in this section the literature on force enhancement due to the presence of a ground with the relevant underlying mechanisms are reviewed and reported the ground or wall alters the vortex shedding from the flapping wing thus altering the force production the potential of ground in enhancing the force coefficients is of interest to the scientific community this can aid during takeoff hovering near the ground and with other phases of flight majority of the existing studies approximate the flapping wing as a 2d airfoil or an ellipse only a few studies reported 3d effects dragonfly shows high acceleration and vertical force with less thrust during voluntary takeoff86 and utilises synchronised flapping with a high aoa whereas out of the ground it reduces the aoa and increases the phase difference which produces less lift and more stable flight similarly beetle takeoff87 shows enhanced lev and increased lift whereas the voluntary takeoff of fruitfly does not show a significant ground effect88 additionally the force on the ground during the butterfly takeoff89 is found to be 40 of the aerodynamic force on the wing moreover bat flight90 showed upto 29 savings in power when flying near the ground furthermore the evolution of wing shape in b utterflies91 was related to their gliding flight near the ground an interesting study on different insects and animals92 discusses the mechanisms used during takeoff with the contribution of leg force and wing force thus the change in force pattern due to the presence of the ground spur additional interest in accurately quantifying this aerodynamic effect one of the earliest studies by r ayner93 applies the lifting line theory to understand the advantage of ground or ground effect on a fixedwing over a smooth wall however the first insectlike flapping wing was numerically studied by gao and l u94 they studied the normal hovering mode fig 1a or horizontal stroke plane flapping commonly used by fruitfly at re 100 and ground clearances of 15c where c the chord length of the wing they demarcated three force regimes based on whether the vertical force was enhanced or diminished due to the ground the force enhancement regime occurs close to the ground the force reduction regime at the intermediate ground heights and the force recovery regime as we move far from the ground j indian inst sci vol 1041 181203 january 2024 journaliiscernetin bioinspired flapping wing aerodynamics a review figure 9 temporally varying gust models adapted and redrawn from76 force enhancement was attributed to enhanced lev close to the ground whereas force reduction was attributed to the interaction of previously shed vortex pair with the lev in the intermediate heights further their studies on the phase difference between the translation and rotation 45 0 45 also showed the three force regimes and higher vertical force for the advanced and delayed rotation cases furthermore variation in amplitude of rotation m 30 45 60 was found to produce higher vertical force with lower amplitude of rotation the force regimes were also confirmed in an experimental study95 the twodimensional numerical studies by zheng et al96 alternatively explained the pressure variation on the leeward and windward sides of the wing to describe the force variation another study97 compared the ground effect of normal fig 1a and watertreading modes fig 1c it was found that the watertreading mode showed only a lift enhancement regime unlike the normal hovering mode yet another study98 on two hovering wings with high stroke plane amplitude am showed vertical force enhancement near the ground following the normal hovering 2d inclined stroke plane hovering fig 1b in the ground effect for the single wing for dragonfly kinematics was investigated99 this study emphasised the force variation due to the ram effect added mass and induced velocity wake capture ram effect is the result of the rammed air underneath the wing due to the ground this causes high pressure underneath the wing leading to high vertical force this was previously reported in stationary wing in ground cases or as cushion effect in helicopters the effect of the rebound vortex on the force production was also reported the major conclusion of this study was that the force enhancement regime was observed only for 193 j indian inst sci vol 1041 181203 january 2024 journaliiscernetin 13 m d manabendra et al the advanced rotation this effect was absent in delayed and the symmetric rotation in addition a study100 on hovering in an inclined stroke plane for different ground clearances 05c 8c interwing distances 11 13c and the phase difference between the wings 0 180 was conducted the study showed force enhancement close to the ground and emphasised that rebound vortex generated by the presence of the ground caused the force changes especially when the interwing distances are small moreover the study showed that ground height played an important role in force enhancement rather than interwing distances while flapping near the ground furthermore the inphase flapping was shown to produce high vertical force with less swirl hence it is preferred for inground flight ground effect was investigated for different stroke inclinations101 or stroke plane angles 30 45 60 75 and different ground clearances h 12 6c measured from the centre of the stroke at re 157 three key findings are obtained from the study in terms of vertical force enhancement firstly although the three force regimes are present in all the stroke plane angles the force enhancement is not significantly different compared to their nonground values secondly the height at which the regimes occur varies for different stroke angles finally it reported a significantly higher lift due to the recirculating dipole jet figure 10 gives the schematic diagram of a typical dipole jet and ground interaction for inclined stroke plane flapping based on d eepthi101 the previously shed vortices are rebound over the earlier formed boundary layer figure 11 gives the dipole jet variation for different ground heights and stroke plane angles through the cycle averaged velocity contours the particular case of 45 h 6c illustrates the dipole jet recirculation and its interaction with the wing to enhance the vertical force this indicates the lift enhancement potential at intermediate heights from the ground by appropriate dipole jet interactions which were not reported earlier by investigating relative streamlines another study102 explained the trajectory of the vortices in the inclined stroke alternatively the forces were explained by splitting the flow based on its interaction with the wing into two parts namely vertical and parallel surface flows leading to positive and negative pressure on the wing respectively and ultimately adding to the lift enhancement a recent study103 at a lower reynolds number re 10 showed that the force enhancement regime 194 13 figure 10 schematic diagram of the dipole jet interaction with the ground figure 11 cycle average velocity for the all the ground heights and the the stroke plane angle reproduced with permission from101 alone was present for inclined stroke plane hovering near the ground further as the reynolds number increases this monotonic increase was shown to become nonmonotonic with three force regimes as reported in other studies influence due to different types of ground topology were also reported in the literature a study104 on four ground topologies namely flat triangular sinusoidal and square surfaces reported that the triangular surface had the highest fluctuation in forces the least being the flat topology more importantly they reported a significantly higher lift in the trough of the sinusoidal wavy platform a study on full and partial j indian inst sci vol 1041 181203 january 2024 journaliiscernetin bioinspired flapping wing aerodynamics a review figure 12 the schematic diagram showing the isosurface of the three dimensional wings at the start of the downstroke it is based on the isocontours from maeda and l iu115 ground effects105 on normal hovering reported three force regimes in full ground effect the partial ground effect for different combinations of vertical and horizontal distance reported to either enhance or reduce the lift similarly a study on ceiling effects106 on normal hovering suggested a monotonic increase in forces while flying near the ceiling further the obstacle effects107 were also studied on the flapping wing by considering obstacles of diameter ranging from 05c to 12c it showed that when the diameter was greater than 2c obstacle effects are similar to infinite ground whereas the lift and drag reductions were reported when the diameters were less than 2c likewise studies on forward flight108109 of insectlike flapping wings also reported a distinct increase in lift and reduction in drag or increased lifttodrag ratio when flying in proximity to ground the vortices were shown to oblate and cause significant changes to the forces110 111 another study showed vertical flapping wing with high frequency and small ground clearance can produce higher lift and thrust furthermore a higher effect of the reynolds number on propulsive efficiency at a lower strouhal number was reported112 moreover 3d wings were shown to be less sensitive to the ground compared to 2d wings on the other hand the power extraction efficiency72113114 improved when the wing was in ground effect numerical and experimental studies on threedimensional flapping wings led to some important results maeda and l iu115 numerically studied the fruitfly hovering for ige inground effect and oge outofground effect at re 137 ige and oge are defined based on the wing length r ige 1r produced higher vertical force due to the air cushion or fountain effect same as the ram effect in 2d when compared to oge 5r however the increase in the force was mainly attributed to the body of the insect figure 12 shows the cushion of air causing a high pressure region underneath the insect in ige the red region represents the high pressure underneath the wing and the arrow illustrates the recirculation causing the cushion effect an experimental investigation116 was carried out with 3d wings resembling that of the fruitfly and hawkmoth both wings were subjected to shm simple harmonic motion for translation and rotation and also to their respective insect kinematics both the wings with the shm showed the three force regimes as in 2d studies for cl and cd the flapping wings of hawkmoth had aerodynamic gains cl cd from ground effect whereas fruitfly did not show significant effect this could be due to the re effect the re of hawkmoth and fruitfly considered in that study are 10000 and 100 respectively the experimental analysis117 for three wing shapes namely fruitfly ff hawkmoth hm and an elliptical wing planform were carried out for 4 kinematics namely shm 45 shm 60 ff hm 45 and 60 represents the maximum twisting anglessame as the m in 2d and at the reynolds numbers of 100 and 5000 it showed three force regimes as in 2d however the force variation was found to be weaker the wing planforms influence on the ground effect was noted to be very low this could mainly be attributed to the aspect ratio and pivot point location of the wings the main finding of the study is that in 3d force enhancement is not significant compared to a 2d wing and is contributed to the cushion effect furthermore the lev remains attached to the wing contributing to the lift peak and hence force variation is independent of ground height as the wake interaction is reduced compared to the 2d wing the reynolds number was found not to have a significant effect on the force production except for the parallel shift in magnitude due to high downwash in another study a simplified 3d flapping wing118 in a horizontal stroke plane motion with shm was found to exhibit the three force regimes 26 increase in vertical force and an 195 j indian inst sci vol 1041 181203 january 2024 journaliiscernetin 13 m d manabendra et al 11 increase in horizontal force in the presence of ground is reported it was found that the ground effect is high below threequarters of the wing length r and disappears above 25r on the other hand aspect ratio of the wings was found to change the vertical forces at hc 1 the enhancement in vertical force significantly increases with the aspect ratio with the increase in hc there is a reduction in vertical force and this effect is more significant for large aspect ratio wings qu et al119 explained the force on the 3d wing in normal hovering with the help of pressure forces caused by parallel and perpendicular surface flows the analysis was analogous to their 2d study102 the study showed that fountain effect is caused by wing root vortex and blockage of the downwash it reported the presence of the wing tip vortex bound vortex and shed vortex these were affected by the presence of ground which causes positive and negative pressure on the wing thus changing the forces on the windward and leeward sides in summary from the twodimensional studies there is a clear indication of force enhancement in hovering due to ground effect close to the ground either ram effect or enhanced lev was used to explain the high forces whereas at intermediate heights interaction with rebound vortex and the dipole jet interaction seem to play a major role 3d wing studies show the ram effect or cushion effect and changes in the force enhancement with wing aspect ratio however on 3d wings vertical force enhancement is relatively lower than that of 2d wings further lev of the wing remain attached and lead to less wake interaction with the ground ultimately force variation with ground height is less when compared to 2d the forward flight studies show high propulsive efficiency and potential energy extraction when flapping near the ground some studies indicated possible lift enhancement in ground effect with nonsmooth topologies the challenge in the field is to understand the lift mechanisms in 3d tandem flapping wings further effect of flexibility in ground need investigation 5 computational techniques for simulating unsteady aerodynamics a survey of literatures reporting numerical simulation of flapping wing reveal that researchers have adopted different numerical methodologies to handle simulations involving moving boundaries while these methodologies have their own merits and demerits choice of the methodology 196 13 for studying the flapping wing system is made by striking a balance between the computational cost and the accuracy achieved using the available computational resources two approaches widely used for handling simulations of flapping wings are as follows dynamic meshing nonbody conformal grid methods in the next subsections we present a brief overview of these two numerical techniques 51 dynamic meshing studies on flapping wings involve simulations of flow around moving boundaries one of the numerical approaches to handle such complex simulations is to use body fitted grid with a dynamically changing mesh to accommodate the movement of solid b oundaries7783 as the flapping trajectories exhibit complex motion combinations of three different techniques under the dynamic meshing approach are employed these are springbased smoothing dynamic layering and local remeshing based on a size function spring based smoothing method relates the edges between two mesh nodes as springs obeying hookes law and reposition the grid points in such a way that the spring forces are in equilibrium after each step of movement of the solid boundary dynamic meshing technique accommodates the solid boundary movement by adding or removing the hexahedral cells adjacent to the solid boundary in accordance with the userspecified cell height thresholds local remeshing technique divides or merges the cells based on the cell skewness minimum and maximum cell dimension and predefined sizing functions simulation of flapping wings are carried out by skilfully employing all these three techniques jointly and ensuring that negative volume formations do not occur during the simulations when the solid boundary moves within the computational domain filled with the finite volume cells while this approach gives an impression of an easily implementable numerical methodology for simulation of flapping wing it is computationally quite demanding moreover this class of methods require specification of certain parameters like the spring constants and thresholds of cell dimensions beyond which the layering and remeshing these parameters are problemspecific and tailoring them for each simulation is highly challenging j indian inst sci vol 1041 181203 january 2024 journaliiscernetin bioinspired flapping wing aerodynamics a review 52 nonbody conformal grid methods simulations of flexible flapping wings with corrugations and other intricate shapes is complicated as the body moves in the fluid such a simulation with moving boundaries using a body conforming grid is complicated as the appropriate remeshing strategies need to be employed furthermore regenerating the grid adds to computational cost as well as decreases the accuracy and the rate of convergence in this subsection we describe two numerical methodologies which fall under the nonbody conformal grid approach for studying flapping wing aerodyanmics immersed boundary methods ibm immersed boundary methods ibm120 is one of the popular methodolgy which has been successfully used to overcome the above mentioned issues associated with body conforming grids in ibm the navierstokes equations are solved on a nonbody conforming background grid which is simply cartesian and the moving body is represented by a set of discrete lagrangian points the flow is initially solved on the background eulerian grid and the resulting intermediate velocities are interpolated on the lagrangian points representing the body the interpolated velocity is then used to calculate the forces on the body and these forces are redistributed back to the background grid using a regularisation operator since the intermediate velocities are interpolated from the background grid to the lagrangian points the moving surface need not coincide exactly with the background grid which makes it particularly suitable for simulations of flapping wing fliers an improved variant of ibm called the ibm projection method proposed by taira and colonius121 considers the lagrangian multiplier to satisfy the noslip condition in this method instead of treating the boundaries explicitly the singular forces due to moving boundaries is incorporated as a part of the poission equation for pressure and solved simultaneously this strictly enforces the noslip condition and as a consequence maintains the accuracy of the method the technique is also recently improved to include fluidstructureinteractions122 to study the deformations of the moving bodies since ibm is highly accurate as well as makes it easier to include complicated geometries it is ideally suited for simulating flapping wing aerodynamics60 latticeboltzmann method lbm another methodology which has gained popularity for studying flapping wing system involving moving boundaries is the latticeboltzmann method lbm researchers have used lbm to study flapping wing systems exhibiting clapandfling kinematics123 and found it robust accurate and computationally beneficial a comprehensive review about the attempts to use lbm for studying the flapping wing aerodynamics is reported by aono et al124the authors have studied different treatments of the noslip condition of lbm for rigid and flexible flapping wings and shown that predictions by lbm are comparable to the conventional navierstokes solutions use of immersed boundary method which provides a framework for using cartesian grid for studying flapping wing systems paves the way for the latticeboltzmann method lbm a nontraditional technique and an alternate to the popular navierstoke approach to simulate the fluid flow lbm primarily deals with solving the kinetic equation for a given particle distribution function and subsequently deriving the macroscopic quantities through hydrodynamic moments of the distribution function few key features of this approach are the solution is local in nature opportunity to use stationery cartesian grids and ease of parallelization however the method suffers from few disadvantages like its applicability to low reynolds number flow and handling of noslip slip and symmetry boundary conditions inspite of these shortfalls from the point of view of understanding the flow physics of flapping wing systems where reynolds number are less than the order of o105124 combination of lbm with ibm is very logical as both the approaches compliment each other many recent researchers have attempted to use the lbmibm combination125128 to study flapping wing aerodynamics usage of lbm has not remained confined to simulation of flapping wing in stationery reference frame researchers have coupled lbm with 6degreeoffreedom rigid body motion solver and demonstrated a fully coupled fluidstructure interaction fsi simulation method to study flapping wing system129 attempts have also been reported to carry out the fsi studies using ibmlbmfem coupling for understanding the nuances of flexible flapping wing aerodynamics130 the formulation has been 197 j indian inst sci vol 1041 181203 january 2024 journaliiscernetin 13 m d manabendra et al found to be computationally beneficial as the ibmlbm formulation allows to compute the lagrangian forces directly and drive the structure 6 post processing approaches for studying flapping wing aerodynamics in the previous section details about different numerical methodologies to simulate the flow over flapping wings have been reported owing to the unsteadiness associated with such flows each simulation provides a huge amount of data to the researchers in order to understand the essence of the study appropriate postprocessing is mandatory in this section a brief technical note on the mathematically advanced approaches used to understand the results of the numerical studies of flapping wing systems are reported in this section for the numerical visualization of the flow field around the flapping wings researchers have used vorticity and galilean invariants like qcriteria 2 and delta criteria131 advanced line integral convolution lic has also been used to capture the coherent structures existing in flow past the flapping wing s ystems132 researchers have employed the lagrangian coherent structures lcs to show the ridges between the vortices generated by single flapping foil133 and tandem wings100 other numerical flow visualization approaches employed to analyse the results are the proper orthogonal decomposition pod131 and dynamic mode decomposition dmd134 while the numerical flow visualization techniques help to gain the insight into the flow physics in the vicinity of the flapping wings quantitative analysis of the force patterns is also imperative this becomes more crucial when parametric studies are carried out and the findings have to be understood from engineering application perspective while studying the literatures on flapping wing systems it was observed that many recurrence paradigms which were primarily developed to understand the dynamic systems135137 were skillfully adopted to qualitatively and quantitatively look at the finding of the flapping wing systems the prominent approaches that have been used to study the aerodynamics of flapping wing are global recurrence plots78 recurrence quantitative analysis138 recurrence period density entropy82 and detrended fluctuation analysis82 bifurcation analysis have also been employed to understand the onset of chaotic behaviour of flapping airfoil139 198 13 7 conclusion insect aerodynamics has fascinated biologists physicists and engineers though their size is small and they fly at low re the insect flight exhibits several complex aerodynamic features there is a considerable difference between the fluid mechanics of birds and insects several papers have studied different aspects of this interesting area in the past two decades in this review paper we elaborated on various unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms associated with single as well as tandem wings the environmental influences like the gust and the presence of ground are also discussed in detail we briefly touched upon computational methods to simulate the flow around flapping wings and postprocessing tools used to analyze the results we also provided several avenues for future research on the aerodynamics of insects additional developments in the understanding of the physics of flapping wings will lead to better design of
