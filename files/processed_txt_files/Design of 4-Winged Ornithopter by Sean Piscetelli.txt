design of 4winged ornithopter sean piscetelli dr mitsunori denda department of mechanical and aerospace engineering rutgers university piscataway nj abstractintromotivation through thousands of years of evolution the dragonfly has become one of the most efficient predators in the animal kingdom due to its ability to fly at relatively fast speeds and then immediately switch to hovering one of the most interesting things about the dragonflys flight is that as the wings flap the wings phase angle changes the change in phase angle and alternating flapping motion allows dragonfly to greatly reduce the amount of drag it experiences the flapping wing flight research team and i have created several different models of a dragonfly in various 3d modeling programs to mimic the abilities of the dragonfly the flapping mechanism is like a dragonfly in which the model has two sets of wings that alternate while flapping the flapping motion of the wings is created by a simple transmission system that allows the power to come from either a rubber band or a microrc motor in one of the models the phase shift of the wings is created by using a ball joint the research and modeling work created in this project will allow others to continue to work on and explore the abilities of fourwinged robotic flight methods a transmission system was created by using two coupling rods a connection pole spins which cause the smaller coupling to rotate that rotation then causes the larger coupling to spin around the smaller one and move up and down in the z axis the end of the larger coupling is connected to a pole that causes two pinned rectangular boxes to rotate back and forth in the z direction the boxes are cut to that they can pass between each other and simulate a flapping motion wings are then connected the ends of the cut boxes background problem a drive system would need to be created that can power two sets of alternating flapping wings that can not only be powered by a rubber band but also a small motor past solution one of the solutions created previously involved using a crankshaft that would rotate and cause the connected wings to flap concern the crankshaft had some limitations such as the position of the wings could not be adjusted before flight goal to create a dragonfly like robot that could have the position of the wings adjusted before flight and utilize a rubber band or motor as the power source results by duplicating the transmission system on the opposite side a second set of wings can be attached the coupling is then set at a different position so that each set of wings flap at alternating times the body is created in such a shape that would allow the bottom bar to have one side cut out the cut out then could house system a rubber band could be used to spin the gear or a small rc motor conclusion using a transmission system that utilizes coupling rods can create a dragonfly like robot that can achieve flight the simplistic design of the robot allows for easy construction the arch frame will allow space for several different types of power systems to be utilized future directions a model for an ornithopter that incorporates asynchronous flapping and a pitching moment in the wings was constructed by another member of the lab jay kapasiawala his model uses a variety of mechanical devices to transform rotational energy into translational motion the offset of specific components in the camshaft can be used to adjust measured values such as stroke plane angle pitch angle and the offset in flapping of the front and rear wings acknowledgements i would like express my deepest thanks to dr mitsunori denda jay kapasiawala all the members of the flapping wing flight research team and the aresty research center
