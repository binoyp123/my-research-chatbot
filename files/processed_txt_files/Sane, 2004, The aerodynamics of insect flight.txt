changes in angle of attack especially at stroke reversal the flight of insects has fascinated physicists and the mutual interaction of the two wings at dorsal stroke biologists for more than a century yet until recently reversal or wingwake interactions following stroke researchers were unable to rigorously quantify the reversal this progress has enabled the development of complex wing motions of flapping insects or measure the simple analytical and empirical models that allow us to forces and flows around their wings however recent calculate the instantaneous forces on flapping insect wings developments in highspeed videography and tools for more accurately than was previously possible it also computational and mechanical modeling have allowed promises to foster new and exciting multidisciplinary researchers to make rapid progress in advancing our collaborations between physicists who seek to explain the understanding of insect flight these mechanical and phenomenology biologists who seek to understand its computational fluid dynamic models combined with relevance to insect physiology and evolution and modern flow visualization techniques have revealed that engineers who are inspired to build microrobotic insects the fluid dynamic phenomena underlying flapping flight using these principles this review covers the basic are different from those of nonflapping 2d wings on physical principles underlying flapping flight in which most previous models were based in particular insects results of recent experiments concerning the even at high angles of attack a prominent leading edge aerodynamics of insect flight as well as the different vortex remains stably attached on the insect wing and does approaches used to model these phenomena not shed into an unsteady wake as would be expected from nonflapping 2d wings its presence greatly enhances the forces generated by the wing thus enabling key words insect flight aerodynamics kramer effect delayed stall quasisteady modeling flapping flight kinematics forces flows insects to hover or maneuver in addition flight forces are leading edge vortex further enhanced by other mechanisms acting during introduction insects owe much of their extraordinary evolutionary success to flight compared with their flightless ancestors flying insects are better equipped to evade predators search food sources and colonize new habitats because their survival and evolution depend so crucially on flight performance it is hardly surprising that the flightrelated sensory physiological behavioral and biomechanical traits of insects are among the most compelling illustrations of adaptations found in nature as a result insects offer biologists a range of useful examples to elucidate both structurefunction relationships and evolutionary constraints in organismal design brodsky 1994 dudley 2000 insects have also stimulated a great deal of interest among physicists and engineers because at first glance their flight seems improbable using standard aerodynamic theory the small size high stroke frequency and peculiar reciprocal flapping motion of insects have combined to thwart simple backoftheenvelope explanations of flight aerodynamics as with many problems in biology a deep understanding of insect flight depends on subtle details that might be easily overlooked in otherwise thorough theoretical or experimental analyses in recent years however investigators have benefited greatly from the availability of highspeed video for capturing wing kinematics new methods such as digital particle image velocimetry dpiv to quantify flows and powerful computers for simulation and analysis using these and other new methods researchers can proceed with fewer simplifying assumptions to build more rigorous models of insect flight it is this more detailed view of kinematics forces and flows that has led to significant progress in our understanding of insect flight aerodynamics experimental challenges because of their small size and high wing beat frequencies it is often quite difficult to quantify the wing motions of free 4192 s p sane flying insects for example an averagesized insect such as the common fruit fly drosophila melanogaster is approximately 23mm in length and flaps its wings at a rate of 200hz just the mere quantification of motion for such small and fastmoving wings continues to pose significant challenges to current technology early attempts to capture freeflight wing kinematics such as ellingtons comprehensive and influential survey ellington 1984c relied primarily on singleimage highspeed cine although quite informative especially because film continues to offer exceptional spatial resolution singleview techniques cannot provide an accurate time course of the angle of attack of the two wings more recent methods have employed highspeed videography willmott and ellington 1997b which offers greater light sensitivity and ease of use albeit at the cost of image resolution a further consideration is that insects rely extensively on visual feedback and hence care must be taken to ensure that lighting conditions do not significantly impair an insects behavior even more challenging than capturing wing motion in 3d is measuring the time course of aerodynamic forces during the stroke at best flight forces have been measured on the body of the insect rather than its wings making it very difficult to separate the inertial forces from the aerodynamic forces generated by each wing cloupeau et al 1979 buckholz 1981 somps and luttges 1985 zanker and gotz 1990 wilkin and williams 1993 in addition tethering can alter the wing motion and thus forces produced as compared with freeflight conditions researchers have overcome these limitations using two strategies the first method involves constructing dynamically scaled models on which it is easier to directly measure aerodynamic forces and visualize flows bennett 1970 maxworthy 1979 spedding and maxworthy 1986 dickinson and g tz 1993 sunada et al 1993 ellington et al 1996 dickinson et al 1999 a second approach is to construct computational fluid dynamic simulations of flapping insect wings liu et al 1998 liu and kawachi 1998 wang 2000 ramamurti and sandberg 2002 sun and tang 2002 the power of both these approaches however depends critically on accurate knowledge of wing motion conventions and terminology because most literature on flapping flight has adopted standard terminology borrowed from fixed wing aerodynamics it is necessary to first develop a nomenclature that allows us to unambiguously distinguish between these two types of flight as in fixed wing aerodynamics wing span refers to the length between the tips of the wings when they are stretched out laterally fig1a whereas wing length refers to the basetotip length of one wing wing span is often given as twice wing length thereby ignoring the width of the animals thorax wing chord refers to the section between the leading and trailing edge of the wing at any given position along the span fig1a the ratio of span to mean chord is an important nondimensional morphological parameter termed aspect ratio angle of attack refers to the angle that the wing chord makes with the relative velocity vector of the fluid far away from the influence of the airfoil ie relative to the farfield flow or freestream flow fig1b the restriction to farfield flow in this definition is necessary because the presence of the airfoil influences the fluid field immediately around it in all real airfoils the process of generating lift creates an induced downwash in the flow all around the wing although the magnitude of this downwash u is small compared with the freestream velocity u it can significantly alter the direction of resultant velocity and thus attenuate the performance of the wing by lowering the angle of attack fig1b munk 1925a kuethe and chow 1998 for this reason it is important to qualify whether the angle of attack is measured with respect to the gross flow in the immediate vicinity of the wing or far away from it the angle of attack relative to the direction of freestream velocity is called geometric angle of attack whereas the altered angle of attack relative to the locally deflected free stream is called the aerodynamic or effective angle of attack where u tan1 u 1 because it is difficult to physically measure the downwashrelated deflection of the free stream most insect flight studies report geometric rather than aerodynamic angles of attack from one stroke to the next insects rapidly alter many kinematic features that determine the time course of flight forces including stroke amplitude angle of attack deviation from mean stroke plane wing tip trajectory and wing beat frequency ennos 1989b ruppell 1989 as well as timing and duration of wing rotation during stroke reversal srygley and thomas 2002 moreover they may vary these parameters on each wing independently to carry out a desired maneuver hence it is misleading to lump all patterns of insect wing motion into a single simple pattern mindful of this vast diversity in wing kinematics patterns the wing motion of insects may be divided into two general patterns of flapping most researchers have restricted their studies to hovering because it is more convenient mathematically to calculate the force balance by equating lift and weight in this case while hovering most insects move their wings back and forth in a roughly horizontal plane whereas others use a more inclined plunging stroke ellington 1984c dudley 2000 despite the predominance of the backandforth pattern the terms upstroke and downstroke are used conventionally to describe the ventraltodorsal and dorsaltoventral motion of the wing respectively it is important to note that as insects fly forward their stroke plane becomes more inclined forward the term wing rotation will generally refer to any change in angle of attack around a chordwise axis during the downstroketoupstroke transition the wing supinates rapidly a rotation that brings the ventral surface of the wing to face upward the wing pronates rapidly at the end of the upstroke bringing the ventral surface to face downward fig1c aerodynamics of insect flight 4193 a edge leading tip base chord

edge d e linear translation in the present review linear or nonflapping translation will refer to airfoils translating linearly fig1d whereas flapping translation will refer to an airfoil revolving around a central axis fig1e since much of the theoretical literature addresses the aerodynamic performance of idealized 2d sections of wings it is important to distinguish between finite and infinite wings the term finite wing refers to an actual 3d wing with two tips and thus a finite span length from the perspective of fluid mechanics the importance of the wing tips is that they create component of fluid velocity that runs along the span of the wing perpendicular to the direction of farfield flow during linear translation by contrast infinite wings are theoretical abstractions of 2d structures that can only create chordwise flow such wings are experimentally realized by closely flanking the tips of the wings with rigid walls that limit spanwise flow thus constraining the fluid to move in two dimensions it is also important to note that by definition a 2d wing cannot perform flapping motions nevertheless 2d formulations based on an infinite wing assumption have often proved very useful in the study of animal flight and are particularly relevant in cases where wings have a high aspect ratio within the context of force and flow dynamics the term steady signifies explicit time independence whereas the word flapping translation unsteady signifies explicit temporal evolution due to inherently timedependent phenomena within the fluid in flapping flight steady does not necessarily imply time invariant forces on airfoils may change with time without being explicitly dependent on time simply because the underlying motion of the airfoils varies if the forces at each instant are modeled by the assumption of inherently timeindependent fluid dynamic mechanisms then such a model is called quasisteady ie steady at each instant but varying with time due to kinematic time dependence background theory for thin airfoils before addressing the specific theoretical challenges posed by insect flight aerodynamics it is first necessary to introduce general equations and physical principles that govern forces and flows created by moving objects submersed in fluids these formulations borrow extensively from methods used by physicists and engineers for nearly 100years to predict the forces created by thin flat wings moving at very low angles of attack prandtl and tietjens 1957b milnethomson 1966 unless otherwise mentioned the theory in this section applies to 2d airfoils moving in incompressible fluids also in the analysis that follows most key physical parameters 4194 s p sane appear as nondimensional entities nondimensional forms of equations are scaleinvariant thereby making it possible to compare flows across a wide range of scales although any reasonable scheme of nondimensionalizing parameters is valid for the purpose of this review the scheme conventionally used is the one developed by ellington 1984be for the purpose of insect flight aerodynamics for more detailed treatments of the physical concepts the reader is referred to classic fluid dynamics texts written by lamb 1945 landau and lifshitz 1959 milnethomson 1966 and batchelor 1973 and books focusing on thin airfoil theory such as glauert 1947 and prandtl and tietjens 1957b the fluid motion around an insect wing like any other submersed object is adequately described by the incompressible navierstokes equation a nondimensional form of which can be written as u t u p u 1 re 2u 2 where u t p are respectively the velocity of the flapping wing relative to its fluid medium time and pressure all these quantities are nondimensionalized denoted by with respect to their corresponding characteristic measures the choice of a characteristic measure is somewhat arbitrary and often based on the physicists intuition of which constants of the system are physically meaningful for example when modeling the flow around a section of a high aspect ratio wing the chord length is often used as the characteristic length measure the operator j i k 3 y x z is a nondimensional form of the vector del operator and i j and k are unit cartesian vectors the lefthand side of equation2 represents the lagrangian or material derivative of the velocity incorporating both the implicit and explicit dependence on time in the eulerian representation the lagrangian derivative is simply the temporal derivative of the motion of a fluid particle as measured by an observer moving with the fluid the denominator of the last term in equation2 is the reynolds number re a nondimensional parameter that describes the ratio of inertia of a moving fluid mass to the viscous dissipation of its motion reynolds number can be calculated by the relation re ul where is the density of the fluid medium u is the velocity of the fluid relative to the moving object l is a characteristic length measure and is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid medium this parameter roughly characterizes the fluid dynamic regime in which an insect operates from laminar for low values of re to turbulent for high values of re when viscosity is large re is small and the last term in equation2 becomes relatively more important than the pressure term when viscosity is negligible the values of re are large and the last term can be dropped from the equation to obtain the inviscid form ie zero viscosity of equation2 usually called the euler equation equation2 also provides the mathematical justification for the use of dynamically scaled physical models the nondimensionalized forces and flows generated by isometrically scaled objects are the same provided that the re are identical the navierstokes equation provides the fundamental theoretical basis for simulating forces and flows from arbitrary or measured kinematics it is not however easy to use in an experimental context because it is quite difficult to measure the pressure field in the space around a wing an alternative and sometimes more convenient form of the navierstokes equation may be derived by taking the curl of both sides in equation2 this eliminates the pressure term because the curl of a gradient vanishes and the equation simplifies to 1 2 u t re 4 the quantity u defined as the vorticity of the fluid is very useful in the conceptualization and characterization of the flows around airfoils for the case of steady inviscid flows 0 and the flows are said to be irrotational when flows are irrotational over all space it is often convenient to express the velocity field as a gradient of a scalar potential function ie u this approach called the potential theory has proven very useful in the elucidation of many basic aerodynamic theorems essentially the technique involves constructing specific forms of that best describe a given fluid dynamic phenomenon under its appropriate initial and boundary conditions vorticity arises from a combination of mutually orthogonal spatial derivatives of velocity at a given point in space thus its value at any given point does not offer a complete picture of the related aerodynamic forces to calculate aerodynamic forces small vorticity elements must be integrated over a surface area around an airfoil using the stokes theorem which relates the area integral of normal component of vorticity to a line integral of velocity around a closed contour bounding a surface s u dl n ds 5 the quantity on the lefthand side of this equation is defined as circulation often denoted by for potential flows its value around any closed contour not enclosing a wing section is zero because vorticity is zero everywhere in accordance with the assumption of irrotational flow however if the closed contour encloses a wing section then the presence of even the slightest viscosity and therefore a finite amount of shear at the wingfluid interface will give rise to finite vorticity and thus nonzero circulation under completely inviscid conditions one would expect the fluid to deflect only minimally by the presence of an airfoil thereby generating a flow field around the wing similar to the one described in fig2a under such conditions the rear stagnation point where velocity is zero would be present not at the tip of the trailing edge but on the upper surface of the aerodynamics of insect flight a b 4195 u dl l c fig2 kutta condition and circulation the kutta condition arises from a sum of the flow around an airfoil placed in an inviscid fluid a to additional circulation arising from the presence of viscosity b to yield a smooth tangential flow from the trailing edge c when satisfied the kutta condition ensures that the vorticity generated at the trailing edge is zero for the inviscid case the net force on the airfoil blue arrow acts perpendicular to the free stream wing however to maintain this flow profile the fluid must turn sharply around the trailing edge causing a singularity or kink in the flow at the trailing edge such a flow profile necessitates a high gradient in velocity at the trailing edge thereby causing high viscous forces due to shear the viscous forces in turn will eventually eradicate this singularity thus the presence of even the slightest viscosity in the fluid functions to smooth out sharp gradients in flow this phenomenon may be incorporated into an otherwise inviscid formulation by adding a circulatory component to the flow field fig2b at a unique value of the additional circulation the stagnation point is stationed exactly at the trailing edge when this condition is met the fluid stream over the plate meets the fluid stream under the plate smoothly and tangentially at the trailing edge fig2c this phenomenon is called the kutta condition which ensures that the slopes of the fluid streams above and below the wing surface are equal and thus the vorticity ie curl of the velocity at the trailing edge is zero in addition when satisfied the kutta condition ensures that the inclined plate imparts a downward momentum to the fluid this in essence is the classic kuttajukowski theory of thin airfoils kuethe and chow 1998 for ideal fluids the net force acts perpendicular to the direction of motion with no component in the plane of motion thus this theory predicts zero resistance in the direction of motion or drag for airfoils moving through fluids at small angles of attack called dalemberts paradox however in the presence of even the smallest amount of shear the net force vector is tilted backward ie normal to the wing even at reasonably high re the net aerodynamic force on the wing surface is usually perpendicular to the surface of the inclined wing rather than to the direction of motion the nonzero component of this force normal to fluid motion is defined as lift and the component parallel to the fluid motion is defined as profile drag the component of drag due to viscous shear along the surface on an airfoil is called viscous drag far from the airfoil the behavior of the fluid is similar to that expected by potential flow theory for this reason although the fluid is not actually irrotational potential theory can be used to conveniently describe such situations as long as the kutta condition is satisfied for steady inviscid flows the kuttajukowski theorem relates circulation and therefore vorticity around an airfoil to forces by the equation 6 note that lift can also be related to vorticity using equation5 in equation6 l is the lift per unit span nondimensionalized with respect to the product of density of the fluid mean chord length and the square of freestream velocity of the fluid u this quantity conventionally multiplied by two is called the lift coefficient and is usually denoted in literature by cl similarly the nondimensional drag is called the drag coefficient and is usually denoted by cd for inviscid fluids undergoing steady nonaccelerated flows d u dl 0 dt 7 u dl constant 8 or when an airfoil starts from rest the net circulation in the fluid before the start of the motion is zero thus equation8 is simply a mathematical expression for kelvins law which states that the total circulation and the total vorticity in an ideal fluid must remain zero at all times in other words if new vorticity or circulation is introduced in an inviscid fluid eg through an application of the kutta condition then it must be accompanied by equal and opposite vorticity physically because the presence of viscosity disallows infinite shear the fluid immediately abounding the airfoil is stationary with respect to the airfoil this condition called the noslip condition is an important boundary condition in most analytical treatments of airfoils due to the noslip condition a continuous layer forms over the airfoil across which the velocity of the fluid goes from zero for the stationary layer adjoining the body to its maximum value corresponding to the freestream flow such regions are called boundary layers and their thickness depends on the reynolds number of the flow schlichting 1979 another boundary condition arises from the requirement that the normal velocity of the fluid on the surface of the airfoil must be zero this condition is sometimes called the no penetration condition these boundary conditions apply at the interface of solids and fluids in free fluids however conditions may often arise where the tangential but not the normal component of velocity is discontinuous across two adjacent layers such interfaces have high vorticity and are called vortex sheets or vortex lines for the twodimensional case when a volume element dv of the fluid has nonzero vorticity it induces a velocity v at a distance r in the neighboring region the expression to calculate this velocity is given by in dimensional form v r 1 dv 4 v r3 9 4196 s p sane where r is the displacement vector or distance vector this is called the biotsavarts law milnethomson 1966 which like its electromagnetic analog is an inverse square relationship this integral must be evaluated over the entire volume of the fluid v equation 9 is very useful in most vorticitybased analyses of fluid dynamics as well as in modeling the effects of vortex dipoles on their surrounding medium the solenoidal ie zero divergence nature of vorticity fields enables vorticitybased methods to define very useful kinematic quantities called moments of vorticity these quantities are useful because their values are independent of the conditions in the interior of a boundary surrounding the region of interest since no new vorticity can be generated within a fluid subject to conservative external forces instead vorticity is generated at the solidfluid boundary and diffuses into the fluid medium truesdell 1954 of particular utility is the first moment of vorticity because it can be related to aerodynamic forces this quantity is given by r dr r 10 where r is the distance from origin of an arbitrary coordinate system moving with the free stream is the vorticity and r is the area of region of interest encompassing all vorticity elements for the twodimensional incompressible viscous case the sectional aerodynamic force f may be derived from the first moment of vorticity by the equation f d d da dt s dt 11 where is fluid density a is the crosssectional area of the airfoil and is the velocity of a point within the airfoil wu 1981 the first term on the righthand side of this equation represents the temporal derivative of the first moment of vorticity which is equal to the force arising from the vorticity created by the movement of the airfoil the second term in the equation represents the inertial force of the fluid displaced by the wing section for an infinitesimally thin wing the sectional area is negligible and force depends solely on the moment of vorticity for the simple case of any bound circulation a stable distribution of vorticity moves with the wing and a constant growth of the moment of vorticity results solely from the wings motion in agreement with the kuttajukowski theorem the sectional lift is equal to the product of the circulation created by a wing and its translational velocity wu 1981 equation 11 is more general however and can account for forces generated when both the strength and distribution of vorticity around the wing are changing as might occur at the start of motion during rapid changes in kinematics or when the wing encounters vorticity created by its own wake or that of another wing theoretical challenges the challenges in adopting the traditional methods described in the previous section to insect flight are manifold and only briefly described here determined primarily by their variation in size flying insects operate over a broad range of reynolds numbers from approximately 10 to 105 dudley 2000 for comparison the reynolds number of a swimming sperm is approximately 102 a swimming human being is 106 and a commercial jumbo jet at 08 mach is 107 at the high reynolds numbers characteristic of the largest insects the importance of the viscous term in equation2 may be negligible and as with aircraft flows and forces may be governed by its inviscid form the euler equation such simplifications may not always be possible for most species whose small size translates into low reynolds numbers this is not to say that viscous forces dominate in small insects to the contrary even at a reynolds number of 10 inertial forces are roughly an order of magnitude greater than viscous forces however viscous effects become more important in structuring flow and thus cannot be ignored due to these viscous effects the principles underlying aerodynamic force production may differ in small vs large insects for tiny insects small perturbations in the fluid may be more rapidly dissipated due to viscous resistance to fluid motion however for larger insects operating at higher reynolds numbers small perturbations in the flow field accumulate with time and may ultimately result in stronger unsteadiness of the surrounding flows even with the accurate knowledge of the smallest perturbations such situations are impossible to predict analytically because there may be several possible solutions to the flow equations in such cases strict static and dynamic initial and boundary conditions must be identified to reduce the number of solutions to a few meaningful possibilities analytical models of insect flight the experimental and theoretical challenges mentioned in the previous sections constrained early models of insect flight to analysis of farfield wakes rather than the fluid phenomena in the immediate vicinity of the wing although such farfield models could not be used to calculate the instantaneous forces on airfoils they offered some hope of characterizing average forces as well as power requirements most notable among these are the vortex models ellington 1978 1980 1984e rayner 1979ab both of which are derived by approximating flapping wings to blades of a propeller or more accurately to idealized actuator disks that generate uniform pressure pulses to impart downward momentum to the surrounding fluid by this method the mean lift required to hover may be estimated by equating the rate of change of momentum flux within the downward jet with the weight of the insect and thus calculating the circulation required in the wake to maintain this force balance a detailed description of these theories appears in rayner 1979ab and ellington 1984e and is beyond the scope of this review which will focus instead on nearfield models despite the caveats presented in the last section a few researchers have been able to construct analytical nearfield aerodynamics of insect flight models for the aerodynamics of insect flight with some degree of success notable among these are the models of lighthill 1973 for the weisfogh mechanism of lift generation also called clapandfling first proposed to explain the high lift generated in the small chalcid wasp encarsia formosa and that of savage et al 1979 based on an idealized form of norbergs kinematic measurements on the dragonfly aeschna juncea norberg 1975 although both these models were fundamentally two dimensional and inviscid albeit with some adjustments to include viscous effects they were able to capture some crucial aspects of the underlying aerodynamic mechanisms specifically lighthills model of the fling lighthill 1973 was qualitatively verified by the empirical data of maxworthy 1979 and spedding and maxworthy 1986 similarly the model of savage et al 1979 was able to make specific predictions about force enhancement during specific phases of kinematics eg force peaks observed as the wings rotate prior to supination that were later confirmed by experiments dickinson et al 1999 sane and dickinson 2002 in studies on dragonflies and damselflies the local circulation method was also used with some degree of success azuma et al 1985 azuma and watanabe 1988 sato and azuma 1997 this method takes into account the spatial along the span and temporal changes in induced velocity and estimates corrections in the circulation due to the wake the more recent analytical models eg zbikowski 2002 minotti 2002 have been able to incorporate the basic phenomenology of the fluid dynamics underlying flapping flight in a more rigorous fashion as well as take advantage of a fuller database of forces and kinematics sane and dickinson 2001 computational fluid dynamics cfd with recent advances in computational methods many researchers have begun exploring numerical methods to resolve the insect flight problem with varying degrees of success smith et al 1996 liu et al 1998 liu and kawachi 1998 wang 2000 ramamurti and sandberg 2002 sun and tang 2002 although ultimately these techniques are more rigorous than simplified analytical solutions they require large computational resources and are not as easily applied to large comparative data sets furthermore cfd simulations rely critically on empirical data both for validation and relevant kinematic input nevertheless several collaborations have recently emerged that have led to some exciting cfd models of insect flight one such approach involved modeling the flight of the hawkmoth manduca sexta using the unsteady aerodynamic panel method smith et al 1996 which employs the potential flow method to compute the velocities and pressure on each panel of a discretized wing under the appropriate boundary conditions also using manduca as a model liu and coworkers were the first to attempt a full navierstokes simulation using a finite volume method liu et al 1998 liu and kawachi 1998 in addition to confirming the smoke streak patterns observed on both real and dynamically scaled 4197 model insects ellington et al 1996 this study added finer detail to the flow structure and predicted the time course of the aerodynamic forces resulting from these flow patterns more recently computational approaches have been used to model drosophila flight for which force records exist based on a dynamically scaled model dickinson et al 1999 although roughly matching experimental results these methods have added a wealth of qualitative detail to the empirical measurements ramamurti and sandberg 2002 and even provided alternative explanations for experimental results sun and tang 2002 see also section on wingwake interactions despite the importance of 3d effects comparisons of experiments and simulations in 2d have also provided important insight for example the simulations of hamdani and sun 2001 matched complex features of prior experimental results with 2d airfoils at low reynolds number dickinson and g tz 1993 twodimensional cfd models have also been useful in addressing feasibility issues for example wang 2000 demonstrated that the force dynamics of 2d wings although not stabilized by 3d effects might still be sufficient to explain the enhanced lift coefficients measured in insects quasisteady modeling of insect flight in the hope of finding approximate analytical solutions to the insect flight problem scientists have developed simplified models based on the quasisteady approximations according to the quasisteady assumption the instantaneous aerodynamic forces on a flapping wing are equal to the forces during steady motion of the wing at an identical instantaneous velocity and angle of attack ellington 1984a it is therefore possible to divide any dynamic kinematic pattern into a series of static positions measure or calculate the force for each and thus reconstruct the time history of force generation by this method any time dependence of the aerodynamic forces arises from time dependence of the kinematics but not that of the fluid flow itself if such models are accurate then it would be possible to use a relatively simple set of equations to calculate aerodynamic forces on insect wings based solely on knowledge of their kinematics although quasisteady models had been used with limited success in the past osborne 1950 jensen 1956 they generally appeared insufficient to account for the necessary mean lift in cases where the average flight force data are available in a comprehensive review of the insect flight literature ellington 1984a used the logic of proofbycontradiction to argue that if even the maximum predicted lift from the quasisteady model was less than the mean lift required to hover then the model had to be insufficient conversely if the maximum force calculated from the model was greater than or equal to the mean forces required for hovering then the quasisteady model cannot be discounted based on a wide survey of data available at the time he convincingly argued that in most cases the existing quasisteady theory fell short of calculating even the required average s p sane lift for hovering and a substantial revision of the quasisteady theory was therefore necessary ellington 1984a he further proposed that the quasisteady theory must be revised to include wing rotation in addition to flapping translation as well as the many unsteady mechanisms that might operate since the ellington review several researchers have provided more data to support the insufficiency of the quasisteady model ennos 1989a zanker and gotz 1990 dudley 1991 these developments have spurred the search for specific unsteady mechanisms to explain the aerodynamic forces on insect wings physical modeling of insect flight given the difficulties in directly studying insects or making theoretical calculations of their flight aerodynamics many researchers have used mechanical models to study insect flight when constructing these models the reynolds number and reduced frequency parameter body velocitywing velocity of the mechanical model is matched to that of an actual insect this condition called dynamic scaling ensures that the underlying fluid dynamic phenomena are conserved because it is relatively easier to measure and visualize flow around the scaled models than on insect wings such models have proved extremely useful in identification and analysis of several unsteady mechanisms such as the clapandfling bennett 1977 maxworthy 1979 spedding and maxworthy 1986 delayed stall dickinson and g tz 1993 ellington et al 1996 rotational lift bennett 1970 ellington 1984d dickinson et al 1999 sane and dickinson 2002 and wingwake interactions dickinson 1994 dickinson et al 1999 these various mechanisms are discussed in the following section unsteady mechanisms in insect flight wagner effect when an inclined wing starts impulsively from rest the circulation around it does not immediately attain its steadystate value walker 1931 instead the circulation rises slowly to the steadystate estimate fig3 this delay in reaching the steadystate values may result from a combination of two phenomena first there is inherent latency in the viscous action on the stagnation point and thus a finite time before the establishment of kutta condition second during this process vorticity is generated and shed at the trailing edge and the shed vorticity eventually rolls up in the form of a starting vortex the velocity field induced in the vicinity of the wing by the vorticity shed at the trailing edge additionally counteracts the growth of circulation bound to the wing after the starting vortex has moved sufficiently far from the trailing edge the wing attains its maximum steady circulation fig3 this sluggishness in the development of circulation was first proposed by wagner 1925 and studied experimentally by walker 1931 and is often referred

circulation builds up around the wing section shown by the increasing thickness of the line drawn around the wing section forces below levels predicted by quasisteady models however more recent studies with 2d wings dickinson and g tz 1993 indicate that the wagner effect might not be particularly strong at the reynolds numbers typical of most insects for infinite wings translating at small angles of attack less than 10 lift grows very little if at all after two chord lengths of travel similar experiments for flapping translation in 3d also show little evidence for the wagner effect dickinson et al 1999 however because this effect relates directly to the growth of vorticity at the onset of motion both its measurement and theoretical treatment are complicated due to interaction with added mass effects described in a later section nevertheless most recent models of flapping insect wings have neglected the wagner effect but see walker and westneat 2000 walker 2002 and focused instead on other unsteady effects clapandfling the clapandfling mechanism was first proposed by weisfogh 1973 to explain the high lift generation in the chalcid wasp encarsia formosa and is sometimes also referred to as the weisfogh mechanism a detailed theoretical analysis of the clapandfling can be found in lighthill 1973 and sunada et al 1993 and experimental treatments in bennett 1977

trailing edge d the leading edge translates away and fluid rushes in to fill the gap between the two wing sections giving an initial boost in circulation around the wing system e f a leading edge vortex forms anew but the trailing edge starting vortices are mutually annihilated as they are of opposite circulation as originally described by weisfogh 1973 this annihilation may allow circulation to build more rapidly by suppressing the wagner effect other variations of this basic mechanism such as the clapandpeel or the nearclapandfling also appear in the literature ellington 1984c the clapandfling is really a combination of two separate aerodynamic mechanisms which should be treated independently in some insects the wings touch dorsally before they pronate to start the downstroke this phase of wing motion is called clap a detailed analysis of these motions in encarsia formosa reveals that during the clap the leading edges of the wings touch each other before the trailing edges thus progressively closing the gap between them fig4ab as the wings press together closely the opposing circulations of each of the airfoils annul each other fig4c this ensures that the trailing edge vorticity shed by each wing on the following stroke is considerably attenuated or absent because the shed trailing edge vorticity delays the growth of circulation via the wagner effect weisfogh 1973 see also lighthill 1973 argued that its absence or attenuation would allow the wings to build up circulation more rapidly and thus extend the benefit of lift over time in the subsequent stroke in addition to the above effects a jet of fluid excluded from the clapping wings can provide additional thrust to the insect fig4c ellington 1984d ellington et al 1996 at the end of clap the wings continue to pronate by leaving the trailing edge stationary as the leading edges fling apart fig4df this process generates a lowpressure region between them and the surrounding fluid rushes in to occupy this region providing an initial impetus to the buildup of circulation or attached vorticity fig4de the two wings then translate away from each other with bound circulations of opposite signs although the attached circulation around each wing allows it to generate lift the net circulation around the twowing system is still zero and thus kelvins law requiring conservation of circulation is satisfied fig4f spedding and maxworthy 1986 as pointed out by lighthill 1973 this phenomenon is therefore also applicable to a fling occurring in a completely inviscid fluid collectively the clapandfling could result in a modest but significant lift enhancement however in spite of its potential advantage many insects never perform the clap marden 1987 others such as drosophila melanogaster do clap under tethered conditions but only rarely do so in free flight because clapandfling is not ubiquitous among flying insects it is unlikely to provide a general explanation for the high lift coefficients found in flying insects furthermore when observed the importance of the clap must always be weighed against a simpler alternative but not mutually exclusive hypothesis that the animal is simply attempting to maximize stroke amplitude which can significantly enhance force generation several studies of peak performance suggest that peak lift production in both birds chai and dudley 1995 and insects lehmann and dickinson 1997 is constrained by the roughly 180 anatomical limit of stroke amplitude animals appear to increase lift by gradually expanding stroke angle until the wings either touch or reach some other morphological limit with the body thus an insect exhibiting a clap may be attempting to maximize stroke amplitude furthermore if it is indeed true that the wagner effect only negligibly influences aerodynamic forces on insect wings the classically described benefits of clapandfling may be less pronounced than previously thought resolution of these issues awaits a more detailed study of flows and forces during clapandfling 4200 a s p sane fresult fnormal fsuction b lift fresult fsuction fnormal drag fig5 polhamus leading edge suction analogy a flow

leading edge and perpendicular to free stream b flow around a thin airfoil the presence of a leading edge vortex causes a diversion of flow analogous to the flow around the blunt leading edge in a but in a direction normal to the surface of the airfoil this results in an enhancement of the force normal to the wing section delayed stall and the leading edge vortex as the wing increases its angle of attack the fluid stream going over the wing separates as it crosses the leading edge but reattaches before it reaches the trailing edge in such cases a leading edge vortex occupies the separation zone above the wing because the flow reattaches the fluid continues to flow smoothly from the trailing edge and the kutta condition is maintained in this case because the wing translates at a high angle of attack a greater downward momentum is imparted to the fluid resulting in substantial enhancement of lift experimental evidence and computational studies over the past 10years have identified the leading edge vortex as the single most important feature of the flows created by insect wings and thus the forces they create polhamus 1971 described a simple way to account for the enhancement of lift by a leading edge vortex that allows for an easy quantitative analysis for blunt airfoils air moves sharply around the leading edge thus causing a leading edge suction force parallel to the wing chord this extra force component adds to the potential force component which acts normal to the wing plane causing the resultant force to be perpendicular to the ambient flow velocity ie in the direction of lift fig5a at low angles of attack this small forward rotation due to leading edge suction means that conventional airfoils better approximate the zero drag prediction of potential theory kuethe and chow 1998 however for airfoils with sharper leading edge flow separates at the leading edge leading to the formation of a leading edge vortex in this case an analogous suction force develops not parallel but normal to the plane of the wing thus adding to the potential force and consequently enhancing the lift component note that in this case the resultant force is perpendicular to the plane of the wing and not to ambient velocity thus drag is also increased fig5b for 2d motion if the wing continues to translate at high angles of attack the leading edge vortex grows in size until flow reattachment is no longer possible the kutta condition breaks down as vorticity forms at the trailing edge creating a trailing edge vortex as the leading edge vortex sheds into the wake at this point the wing is not as effective at imparting a steady downward momentum to the fluid as a result there is a drop in lift and the wing is said to have stalled for several chord lengths prior to the stall however the presence of the attached leading edge vortex produces very high lift coefficients a phenomenon termed delayed stall fig6a the first evidence for delayed stall in insect flight was by provided by maxworthy 1979 who visualized the leading edge vortex on the model of a flinging wing however delayed stall was first identified experimentally on model aircraft wings as an augmentation in lift at the onset of motion at angles of attack above steadystate stall walker 1931 at the lower reynolds numbers appropriate for most insects the breakdown of the kutta condition is manifest by the growth of a trailing edge vortex which then grows until it too can no longer stay attached to the wing dickinson and g tz 1993 as the trailing edge vortex detaches and is shed into the wake a new leading vortex forms this dynamic process repeats eventually creating a wake of regularly spaced counterrotating vortices known as the von karman vortex street fig6a the forces generated by the moving plate oscillate in accordance to the alternating pattern of vortex shedding although both lift and drag are greatest during phases when a leading edge vortex is present forces are never as high as during the initial cycle the leading edge vortex may be especially important because insects flap their wings at high angles of attack an experimental analysis of delayed stall in 2d showed that flow separates to form a leading edge vortex at angles of attack above 9 a threshold well below those used by insects dickinson and g tz 1993 this study also directly measured timevariant force coefficients and showed that the values created by the presence of the leading edge vortex were at least sufficient to account for the missing force in quasisteady models however direct evidence that insect wings actually create leading edge vortices came from ellington et aerodynamics of insect flight a b 2d linear translation 4201 3d flapping translation leading edge vortex lift net force u drag mvi starting vortex mvf mv von karman street fig6 a comparison of 2d linear translation vs 3d flapping translation a 2d linear translation as an airfoil begins motion from rest it generates a leading and trailing edge vortex during translation the trailing edge vortex is shed leading to the growth of the leading edge vortex which also sheds as the airfoil continues to translate this motion leads to an alternate vortex shedding pattern from the leading and trailing edges called the von karman vortex street this leads to a time dependence of the net aerodynamic forces blue arrows measured on the airfoil b 3d flapping translation as in a when an airfoil undergoing flapping translation starts from rest it generates a leading and trailing edge vortex however as the motion progresses the leading edge vortex attains a constant size and does not grow any further because no new vorticity is generated at the leading edge there is no additional vorticity generated at the trailing edge and the airfoil obeys the kutta condition when established the kutta condition ensures that there is a net change in the direction of momentum resulting in a reactive aerodynamic force on the airfoil black arrows mvi signifies initial momentum mvf signifies final momentum and mv signifies the difference between initial and final momenta after establishment of the kutta condition the measured net aerodynamic forces blue arrows stay stable over a substantial period during translation and do not show time dependence for reynolds numbers of 100 this force acts normally to the wing and can be decomposed into mutually orthogonal lift and drag components green arrows ultimately however the net downward momentum imparted by the airfoil to the fluid causes a downwash that slightly lowers the constant value of the net aerodynamic force on a steadily revolving wing al 1996 who used smoke to visualize the flow around both real and 3d model manduca sexta at a reynolds number in the range of 103 in contrast to 2d models the leading edge vortex was not shed even after many chords of travel and thus never created a pattern analogous to a von karman street thus the wing never stalls under these conditions fig6b these observations have been confirmed at lower reynolds numbers in experiments on model fruit fly wings which showed that forces like flows are remarkably stable during constant flapping dickinson et al 1999 what causes this prolonged attachment of the leading edge vortex on a flapping wing compared to the 2d case in their model hawkmoth ellington and coworkers observed a steady spanwise flow from the wing hinge to approximately threequarters of the distance to the wing tip at which point the leading edge vortex detaches from the wing surface this spanwise flow is entrained by the leading edge vortex causing it to spiral towards the tip of the wing fig7 a similar flow was observed by maxworthy 1979 during early analysis of the 3d fling because this flow redirects momentum transfer in the spanwise direction it should correspondingly reduce the momentum of the flow from the chordwise direction causing the leading edge vortex to remain smaller a smaller leading edge vortex allows the fluid to reattach more easily and the wing can sustain this reattachment for a longer time thus axial flow appears to serve a useful role by maintaining stable attachment of the leading edge vortex as pointed out by ellington a similar leading edge vortex is stabilized by an axial flow generated due to the backsweep of wings in delta aircraft such as the concorde creating one of the more 4202 s p sane fig7 stable attachment of the leading edge vortex as the flapping wing translates a spanwise velocity gradient interacts with the leading edge vortex causing the axial flow to spiral towards the tip the axial flow transports momentum out of the vortex thus keeping it stably attached the vortex detaches at about threequarters of the distance to the wing tip and is shed into the wake thick black arrows indicate downwash due to the vortex system generated by the wing in its surrounding fluid figure adapted from vandenberg and ellington 1997 remarkable analogies between the biological and mechanized worlds recently using dpiv to map the flow structure on a model fruit fly wing re115 birch and dickinson 2001 reported stable attachment of the leading edge vortex in the absence of a prominent helical vortex whereas the axial flow within the core of the vortex was nearly an order of magnitude lower than on the manduca model in re103 range they observed a prominent axial flow within a broad sheet of fluid on top of the wing behind the leading edge vortex that rolls into a prominent tip vortex these results from model hawkmoths and fruit flies suggest that the 3d flow structure may be quantitatively different at high and low reynolds numbers interestingly the observed differences in the 3d flow structures do not seem to be reflected in the measured forces cfd simulations in 2d wang 2000 hamdani and sun 2000 and 3d ramamurti and sandberg 2002 airfoils show a remarkable similarity in forces calculated at re100 and those calculated using the inviscid euler equation corresponding to an infinite re or re100000 in the case of hamdani and sun 2000 these results suggest that although viscosity is necessary for vorticity generation its contribution to net forces is very small beyond re100 and the forces may be predominantly due to the dynamic pressure gradients across the wing the above conclusions from cfd models are also supported by empirical data usherwood and ellington 2002b together these results present a somewhat paradoxical conclusion that forces remain relatively unaffected even when flow structures vary substantially with an increase in reynolds number above 100 although a detailed explanation of above results awaits a more rigorous quantification of simultaneous flow and force data these differences should not obscure the more salient general features of separated flow at high angles of attack in particular the absence of periodic shedding in these recent experiments indicates that the 3d flow around a flapping wing may be remarkably selfstabilizing over a reynolds number range of 100 for the existence of such stability the creation of vorticity at the leading edge is matched perfectly by the convection and diffusion of vorticity into the wake thus creating a stable equilibrium this situation may be analogous to the continuous attachment of vortices behind bluff bodies at reynolds numbers below the threshold for von karman shedding see for example acheson 1990 what maintains the balance in creation and transport of vorticity and how does this change with reynolds number similarly what determines the magnitude of the leading edge vortex supported by a flapping wing at equilibrium given the importance of the leading edge vortex the answers to these questions are critical to determining the limits of aerodynamic performance in insect flight kramer effect rotational forces near the end of every stroke insect wings undergo substantial pronation and supination about a spanwise axis which allows them to maintain a positive angle of attack and generate lift during both forward and reverse strokes furthermore there is some evidence from both tethered dickinson et al 1993 and free srygley and thomas 2002 flight that insects alter the timing of rotation during flight maneuvers the aerodynamic significance of these rotations for flapping flight has been studied by bennett 1970 and more recently in detail by sane and dickinson 2002 but it is well known in the aerodynamic literature in the context of fluttering airplane wings due to the extensive theoretical work of munk 1925b glauert 1929 theodorsen 1935 fung 1969 and supporting experimental evidence from kramer 1932 reid 1927 farren 1935 garrick 1937 silverstein and joyner 1939 and halfman 1951 when a flapping wing rotates about a spanwise axis while at the same time translating flow around the wing deviates from the kutta condition and the stagnation region moves away from the trailing edge this causes a sharp dynamic gradient at the trailing edge leading to shear because fluids tend to resist shear due to their viscosity additional circulation must be generated around the wing to reestablish the kutta condition at the trailing edge in other words the wing generates a rotational circulation in the fluid to counteract the effects of rotation the reestablishment of kutta condition is not instantaneous however but requires a finite amount of time if in this time the wing continues to rotate rapidly then the kutta condition may never be actually observed at any given instant of time during the rotation but the tendency of the fluid towards its establishment may nevertheless dictate the generation of circulation thus extra circulation proportional to the angular velocity of rotation continues to be generated until smooth tangential flow can be established at the trailing edge depending on the direction of rotation this additional circulation causes rotational forces that either add to or subtract from the net force due to translation this effect is also often called the kramer effect after m kramer who first described it kramer 1932 or alternatively as rotational forces sane and dickinson 2002 aerodynamics of insect flight using the conceptual framework described above sane and dickinson 2002 measured rotational coefficients kramer effect and following the recommendation of ellington 1984df included them with the translational coefficients in the existing quasisteady models the revised quasisteady model was able to capture the corresponding time history of the force traces in addition to the strokeaveraged forces better than the quasisteady models that take only translation into account similar rotational force peaks were observed in cfd simulations by sun and tang 2002 who described these peaks as arising from fast pitchingup rotation of the wing near the end of the stroke but appear essentially complementary to the kramer effect both the revised quasisteady model and cfd models show close agreement with the experimental measurements it is important to note that the kramer effect or the rotational force of sane and dickinson 2002 is fundamentally different from the magnus force to which a loose qualitative analogy was drawn in the past literature bennett 1970 dickinson et al 1999 leading to some confusion magnus force arises from circulation generated by a blunt body such as a spinning cylinder or sphere set into translational motion with respect to the real fluid see for example prandtl and tietjens 1957a although the magnus force can be calculated from this circulation using kuttajukowski theorem as in airfoils it excludes either explicit or implicit application of the kutta condition because by definition blunt bodies have no surface singularities where such a condition can hold on the other hand the application of the kutta condition is necessary and fundamental to all calculations of aerodynamic forces on thin airfoils as a result the mechanism of magnus force applies only in relation to cylinders spheres and blunt objects and extending it to complex surfaces such as thin airfoils or other surfaces with sharp edges is at best problematic schlichting 1979 not surprisingly therefore the magnus effect does not provide an explanation of the rotational forces during pronation or supination sun and tang 2002 nor is it possible to apply it to calculations of forces or circulation on a flapping thin airfoil without making severe assumptions walker 2002 added mass all the forces described in the previous section belong to the class of circulatory forces because their action can be mathematically described by calculating the changes in the velocity potential around the wing as previously described an inclined wing moving at a constant angle of attack is subject to aerodynamic forces that can be adequately modeled by accounting for the circulation around the wing using standard potential theory other effects such as leading edge separation may also be modeled by a variation of the same approach see for example minotti 2002 however when the wing accelerates it encounters a reaction force due to the accelerated fluid this reactive noncirculatory force sedov 1965 falls outside the realm of standard circulationbased steadystate 4203 analyses and is variably called added mass vogel 1994 added mass inertia sane and dickinson 2001 acceleration reaction daniel 1984 denny 1993 or virtual mass ellington 1984b within the biological literature because these forces typically occur at the same time as the circulatory forces it is usually difficult to measure them in isolation in addition they also pose some difficulty in modeling because added mass inertia has components arising from acceleration of fluid relative to the wing rotational acceleration due to wing rotation and a crossterm arising from translational velocity and angular velocity ellington 1984d it is possible however to estimate the magnitude of added mass relative to the contribution of circulatory forces methods of calculating added mass have been outlined in various texts most notably in sedov 1965 denny 1993 and lighthill 1975 or in research articles by ellington 1984d sunada et al 2001 sane and dickinson 2002 zbikowski 2002 and minotti 2002 the added mass force is typically modeled in quasisteady terms using a timeinvariant addedmass coefficient and any time dependence is implicit due to the time course of wing acceleration in a computational study of a 2d insect wing hamdani and sun 2000 simulated a series of impulsive starts at different accelerations their force predictions based on the time derivative of the moment of vorticity integral equation11 over their simulated flow field accurately matched prior experimental results the acceleratory forces at the start of translation corresponded to a rapid rise in the moment of vorticity at this early stage of motion the rise in the moment of vorticity is due to both the convection and growth of vorticity thus added mass forces are closely tied to the initial stages of flow separation and fluid acceleration and further experimental investigations offer a promising area for further research wingwake interactions the reciprocating pattern of wing motion used by insects suggests that their wings might potentially interact with the shed vorticity of prior strokes that such interactions can result in significant forces was first observed during 2d motion on an inclined plate dickinson 1994 a similar phenomenon was also observed with both force measurements and flow visualization on a 3d mechanical model of a fruit fly dickinson et al 1999 as the wing reverses stroke fig8ac it sheds both the leading and the trailing edge vortices fig8c these shed vortices induce a strong intervortex velocity field the magnitude and orientation of which are governed by the strength and position of the two vortices fig8cd as the wing reverses direction it encounters the enhanced velocity and acceleration fields thus resulting in higher aerodynamic forces immediately following stroke reversal fig8e this phenomenon has been alternatively called wake capture or more accurately wingwake interaction the magnitude and relative strengths of the shed vortices and therefore wake capture are strongly dependent 4204 s p sane a u b c d e f u fig8 a hypothesis for wingwake interactions parts af depict a wing section as it reverses stroke as the wing transitions from a steady translation a

record light blue arrows which is sometimes called wake capture or wingwake interaction u freestream velocity on the kinematics of the wing immediately before and after stroke reversal recently sun and tang 2002 performed cfd simulations for the kinematics similar to those in dickinson et al 1999 and have proposed that the initial force peak is due to acceleration of the wing rather than due to wingwake interactions to show that wingwake interaction produces a negligible effect on forces they started a wing from rest in still air and compared the calculated forces with the forces on a wing undergoing identical motion after stroke reversal interestingly the forces were nearly identical in the two cases and they did not observe any force peaks due to wingwake interactions second they varied the period of acceleration of the wing immediately after stroke reversal for higher values of acceleration they calculated force peaks similar in magnitude and dynamics to the experiments of dickinson et al 1999 from these experiments they concluded that the forces related to the acceleration of the wing not wingwake interactions fully account for the force peaks immediately following stroke reversal these results are puzzling for two reasons first to verify their hypothesis of wingwake interactions dickinson et al 1999 stopped the wing at stroke reversal they argued that if forces were augmented due to relative velocity between the wing and the induced wake then even a nonaccelerating wing should continue to generate forces as it encounters the wake from its previous stroke the results of these experiments fig4 of dickinson et al 1999 strongly suggested that wingwake interactions can indeed contribute significantly to the aerodynamic forces immediately after stroke reversal second they visualized the nearfield wake structure at the instant of stroke reversal using particle image velocimetry these images revealed the substantial wake induced by the previous stroke and also demonstrated its physical interaction with the wing in the period immediately following stroke reversal fig8ae it seems unlikely that this wingwake interaction would not be reflected in the time history of the corresponding aerodynamic forces at present the cause of this discrepancy between the cfd simulations sun and tang 2002 and the particle image velocimetric observations dickinson et al 1999 remains unclear in any case these results strongly suggest that neither the wing acceleration nor the wingwake interactions should be ignored when modeling wake capture current status of quasisteady modeling many of the mechanisms outlined above may be described by simple algebraic equations provided steadystate assumption holds true because it is difficult to solve for the full navierstokes equations for flows around insect wings equations based on quasisteady assumptions still hold some practical utility in a comprehensive model of insect flight the lift and drag

coefficient of lift fig9 shows a comparison among the liftdrag polars during steady translation in nonflapping finite and infinite wings as well as for flapping wings the aerodynamic coefficients measured on flapping wings are significantly higher than the corresponding coefficients for nonflapping finite wings there are several explanations for the significant differences first the data on nonflapping finite wings represent timeaveraged forces collected on finite wings placed at fixed angles of attack in a wind tunnel if the nonflapping finite wings exhibited von karman vortex shedding the force records would fail to reflect the benefits of an initial temporary attachment of the leading edge vortex thus causing the force coefficients on flapping wings to be higher than the force coefficients for nonflapping finite wings moreover the steady coefficients measured on flapping wings are similar in magnitude to the early prestall force coefficients measured at two chord length motion and before von karman shedding occurs on an impulsively started 2d plate whereas the nonflapping finite wings are similar in magnitude to the late poststall force coefficients of the same profiles dickinson and g tz 1993 the instantaneous forces measured on a flapping wing at constant angles of attack provide further evidence that flapping wings do not show von karman shedding in addition following the inertial transients arising from the impulsive start of the airfoil the instantaneous force coefficients reach steady values that remain constant through a substantial duration of flapping translation dickinson et al 1999 however if the wing continues the flapping translation the wings eventually show some decline in performance this may be explained by the fact that a wing revolving in a propellerlike fashion eventually establishes a strong downwash in the farfield thus lowering the effective angles of attack usherwood and ellington 2002a an alternative view is that under steady flow conditions nonflapping finite wings with aspect ratios typical of insect wings do not exhibit vortex shedding like flapping wings they rapidly attain a stable pattern of flow although the strength of the total circulation is substantially lower than with a flapping motion at comparable angles of attack in this view there is some feature of flapping motion such as the spanwise gradient in chordwise velocity that allows the leading edge vortex to attain a greater strength than in the nonflapping case in the future these issues might be resolved by 4206 s p sane simultaneous flow visualization and force measurement under the two experimental conditions of special interest are differences in convective processes such as axial flow ellington et al 1996 downwash induced by tip vortices or diffusion that might limit the growth of vorticity at the leading edge to different degrees in the two cases when we revisit the proofbycontradiction method using these higher values of steady lift and drag coefficients appearing in the recent literature on flapping wings the calculated average forces are proportionally higher and sufficient to explain hovering this has led to a revival of the quasisteady models in recent years indeed when rotational coefficients are included along with the translational coefficients in the quasisteady model the time course of aerodynamic force generation is also well captured sane and dickinson 2002 however such a model cannot yet account for the force peaks resulting from wingwake interactions future research and directions because both the absence of stall and kramer effect can be modeled using potential flow theory the above results suggest that simple analytical models can satisfactorily describe the aerodynamic forces due to translation and rotation in a flapping wing it is also necessary to incorporate the unsteady components due to wingwake interactions and the noncirculatory forces due to added mass into such models finally it is necessary to account for wing flexibility since the above models are based on rigid wings in general the problem of wing flexibility is very complex due to the various aeroelastic effects on a moving wing however recent studies on wing flexibility indicate that most of the wing flexion occurs not from the aeroelastic interactions between the wing and the fluid but simply from the inertial bending of the wing on account of its mass distribution daniel and combes 2002 these results promise to substantially simplify the incorporation of wing flexion into current quasisteady models these developments in the area of insect flight aerodynamics will prove critical to biologists who seek to understand how flight and flightrelated adaptations have enabled insects to be so extraordinarily successful in the course of their evolution in addition they also promise to be useful in breaking new ground in technology the recent interest in developing insectinspired micro air vehicles mavs also called micromechanical flying insects or mfis has fostered a number of strong collaborations between analytical and computational fluid dynamicists microrobotics engineers and insect flight biologists ellington 1999 zbikowski 2002 the combination of expertise from these different areas promises to help insect flight biologists ask questions and devise experiments that were previously inconceivable from an academic standpoint the success of these projects will allow us to satisfactorily demonstrate our understanding of the fundamental fluid
