fields of biologic research that has been intensively developed throughout the last two centuries although it may have come of age functional morphology has not become old throughout the twentieth century it has been used to investigate phenomena predicted by evolutionary theorythe bestdeveloped branch of theoretical biology from the early 1900s until the present the most popular research topic in functional morphology has been the directionality of evolution the effect of natural selection we now recognize that evolution is channeled by development and that this process proceeds parallel to the constraints posed by natural selection hence one of the crucial points of the theory of evolution is to determine the balance between ontogenetic and ecologic constraints this is the main problem posed by this book the interaction of the two forces in biologic pattern formation is unlikely to be completely characterized in the framework of a single study this is made even less likely because the material presented here approaches the problem from only one side asking about the extent that the knowledge of function contributes to our understanding of the reasons for structural diversity however it is interesting to search for general biologic regularities from the viewpoint that theoretical considerations should be compared to results derived from experimental studies and natural observations this is the current approach to the comparative functional morphology of insect wings insect wings can be treated as flat structures this feature makes the wings almost uniquely convenient objects for a survey of comparative morphology the broad diversification of wing shapes and their constructions within insect class provide fruitful soil for analyses and reconstructions of historical trends xii i preface an mowledgments the main function of insect wings is flapping flight with respect to the distance covered during locomotion energy expenses are fourfold lower in flying than in walking animals schmidtnielsen 1972 the high adaptive significance of this kind of locomotion has favored independent development of flight in several unrelated groups of animals in insects flight probably involves more diverse mechanisms than in any other animal taxon although disagreement remains on the way insects manage to stay aloft certain regularities can clearly be described thus explaining particular trends in insect evolution the first chapter presents a taxonomy and nomenclature of insects and provides a brief account of the main types of flapping flight in insects the following three chapters are devoted to the functional morphology of wings usually functional morphologists proceed from structure to function first describing the diversity of construction and then showing how the structures work see pringle 1963 brodsky 1994 dudley 1999 because the principal aim of this book is quite different we will approach the object from the opposite direction beginning with flight aeromechanics chapter 2 next treating wing motion chapter 3 and finally morphology chapter 4 this approach is perceptually easier because the diversity of the phenomena considered evidently increases from aerodynamics to wing construction the book ends with an appendix containing a critical review of the ways in which functional morphology can contribute to general evolutionary theory of the main principles of morphofunctional construction of organisms and of the ways that these principles could define historical change of living beings i am not going to provide an overview of the structural diversity of the flight apparatus and subordinate organs in insects hence the book lacks descriptions of the cuticular exoskeleton and thoracic muscles and it does not contain analytic models for the energetics of flapping flight for a comprehensive current reference see dudley 1999 rather i have concentrated on disputable points in the functional morphology of wings each chapter is intrinsically independent of the others and can be read separately potentially the book should be of interest to three groups of biologists the first are the students of evolutionary process throughout the book and especially in the appendix they will be exposed to concepts and data of purely russian origin both classic and modern these concepts are mostly unknown in the west owing to the splendid isolation caused by obvious historical reasons however many of these concepts prove to be in good agreement with and complementary to current aspects of western bi preface and ackn 1gments i xiii ology hence they may be of interest to western readers main evolutionary events accompanied by generation of higher taxa occur on large continents and not on islands in a similar way science develops more rapidly in such zones whenever it is provided with a rich diversity of concepts elaborated within different cultural traditions the second part of my audience consists of entomologists who may be interested in the novel system of insect classification the section written by a p rasnitsyn they will also encounter classification and simple explanation of the evolutionary origin of the major types of insect flight kinematics as well as grounds for nomenclature and homology of insect wing furrows and venation there is also a set of comparative data on functional morphology of the wings of endopterygote insects the insect orders are distinguished mostly by the features of their mouthparts and flight systems this makes the adaptive significance and corresponding bases of the evolutionary origins of the principal morphologic and kinematic traits of the orders especially important the third group of potential readers are experts in animal locomotion both aerial and aquatic they should be interested in the present description of the process of vortex generation associated with wing movements they might also benefit from the general scheme of evolution of flight in the main orders of winged insects beginning from a hypothetical origin of the wings and an initial state of their kinematics of course the aeromechanics of flapping flight is far from common biological knowledge hence i have tried to make explanations as easy to understand as possible and have supplied the text with supplementary illustrations i thank peng chai

insect wings 1 classification of insects and their wingbeat kinematics the organization and the nomenclature of higher insect taxa used in this book differ substantially from those generally accepted in current entomological literature therefore before describing the diversity of insect flappingflight kinematics it is necessary to present a brief account of insect systematics 11 insect taxonomy by alexandr p rasnitsyn insect systematics especially at and above the taxonomic level of the order has undergone continuous reorganization and improvement since linne 1758 in particular these changes have affected the content of the class insecta which initially corresponded more closely to the current concept of the phylum arthropoda the supraordinal taxonomic level and the content of three of seven linnean orders aptera neuroptera and coleoptera the order hemiptera was divested of thrips and in modern systems often has superordinal rank the three other orders diptera lepidoptera hymenoptera persist essentially intact since those remote times the revision of the class insecta was timeconsuming latreille 1810 separated crustaceans and arachnids from insects in the early nineteenth century and removed myriapods fifteen years later latreille 1825 however it took more than a century to classify the entognathous orders protura collembola and diplura as hexapod myriapods rather than true insects remington 1955 a p rasnitsyn is the leader of the arthropoda laboratory paleontological institute of the russian academy of sciences 123 profsoyuznaya str moscow 117647 russia email rasnaglasnetru 2 i form and fw of insect wings handschin 1958 sharov 1966 an inference that remains a subject of debate cf rasnitsyn 1976a kristensen 1981b 1992 clearing insect orders of extraneous elements required less time considerable progress was achieved by brauer 1885 who left only two unnatural orders an orthoptera that included embiids and a corrodentia that contained psocids termites and lice brauer correctly segregated the holo and heterometabolan orders and moreover assembled the future palaeopteran polyneopteran except earwigs paraneopteran and mecopteroid orders however no formal taxa were proposed for these groups and some of his orders orthoptera rhynchota neuroptera etc are now considered to be superorders the next important step was made by handlirsch 19068 1911 1925 who established numerous extinct orders split the rest of the composite extant orders and diversified the system of intercalar taxa between the subclass pterygota and its component orders many of his new taxa still exist the first and only system of insects that won worldwide appreciation and incomparable longevity was developed by the russian entomologist martynov 1923 1924a 1925 1938 this system with or without minor modifications is still in wide though not universal use martynov proposed that a basic dichotomy of the winged insects pterygota segregates them into two divisions of the highest rank depending on whether they can fold their wings at rest over their abdomen neoptera comprising the majority of insect orders or whether they cannot palaeoptera namely mayflies dragonflies and several paleozoic orders close to palaeodictyoptera this idea is incorporated in various contemporary systems either essentially intact eg ross 1965 gillott 1980 arnett 1993 or with a group discarded because of inferred paraphyly palaeoptera in boudreaux 1979 and kristensen 1981b 1992 polyneoptera in kukalovapeck 1992 poly and paraneoptera are merged back into exopterygota by carpenter 1992 despite the evident advantages of martynovs system his intellectual descendants realized a different and more radical trend in higherlevel insect taxonomy this group included students of rohdendorf who had studied under martynov and who inherited and expanded martynovs laboratory after his death in 1938 specialized study of the taxonomic diversity of fossil insects in close conjunction with the taxonomy and evolution of the living forms prepared them to search for the basal insect dichotomies outside of the traditional approach the first step was made by sharov 1966 who hypothesized that ances classification of insects and their wingbear kinematics i 3 tral pterygotes his new order protoptera were able to fold their wings at rest albeit imperfectly further incremental development of sharovs ideas produced an essentially new insect system and phylogenetic scheme rasnitsyn 1976a 1980 rohdendorf and rasnitsyn 1980 the main feature of this approach is appreciation of the neopterous nature of ancestral pterygotes palaeoptera represent a disparate polyphyletic group rasnitsyn 1997 and the basic pterygote dichotomy segregates gryllones polyneoptera in martynovs system and scarabaeones the remainder of pterygota before presenting an overview of the most recent version of this system another feature of the present taxonomic proposal should be explained the difficulties encountered in working with an uncodified nomenclature inspired rohdendorfs 1977 rasnitsyn 1982 plan to codify the higher taxa see also rasnitsyn 1996 an approach that has been used in the proposed system although the following system does not require use of the codified nomenclature i have little doubt that eventually this fully codified nomenclature will be appreciated it provides the only way to stabilize the names of the higher taxa in a manner equivalent to that which has already been established with the names of the lower taxonomic ranks class

identification of insect orders relies considerably on features of the wings insects can have one or two wing pairs with one pair larger than the other either fore or hindwings can be longer depending on taxon the wings can be hardened elytra membranous or leathery fringed scaled or hairy veins and cells can be numerous or strongly reduced from this one is able to suggest that the wingsand flying as their main functionplayed quite an important role in the evolution of insects indeed after its origination flight evolved in almost all insect orders the historical change of flight imposed constraints on the general appearance of subordinate taxa thus considerably channeling their evolution hence the traditional classification and nomenclature of insect orders was based mainly on features of wing appara 12 i form and ion of insect wings tus especially since the wings are more frequently found as fossils than any other part of an insects body martynov 1938 insects possess the most diverse wing structure and kinematics of all flying animals shvetz and coworkers 1979 classified insect flapping flight according to the character of flight trajectory and recognized three main flight types straight hovering and flitting the last a mixture of the first two ellington 1984 suggested a differentiation of flight types according to the position of the stroke plane which can be horizontal inclined or vertical see sec 21 nevertheless a detailed classification ie tree or gridlike system of flight modes was never developed as most authors concentrated on intensive studies of model species and devoted little attention to the comparison of different groups the early attempt of rohdendorf 1949 dealt not with flight itself but with the morphology of the wing apparatus brodsky 1988 1994 listed flight modes but did not bring them into mutual correspondence that is he only typologized the object moreover his flight types coincided with insect taxa and therefore lacked independent significance as will be shown further partitioning of functional diversity does not concur with the taxonomic system several flight modes can occur in one group of insects and can even be demonstrated in the different behavioral repertoires of a single insect species for example dragonflies can use up to four distinct kinematic patterns sec 35 in the subsequent text the term wing couple signifies a forewing and a hindwing taken together whereas wing pair indicates a left and a right wing that is either forewings or hindwings the newly suggested classification fig 18 is based mainly on the terminology of shwanvitch 1946 1948 1949 the difference is that in the cited works the terms anteromotoric and posteromotoric have purely morphologic meaning designating the greater size of either the fore or the hindwings respectively as follows from the material presented subsequently the relative size of the two wing pairs is determined by a functional character which consists in a correlation between the beginning of the stroke cycle of the fore and hindwings the only known exception are some stoneflies which start each stroke with their forewings although their hindwings are enlarged the proposed scheme includes only those insects that are capable of active aerial flight not presented for example are some species of caddisflies phryganeida limnephilidae baicalini kozhov 1963 1973 and bugs cimicida helotrephidae pleidae popov 1971 that have lost their hindwings together with the ability to fly the term morphological wing merely corre classification of insects and

cetonia potosia are regarded as twowinged because they never open their elytra small wing rudiments or strongly modified wing derivatives as in nemopteridae unable to evoke any vorticity are not considered the main intergroup differences reflect the number of working wings and interrelationships between the fore and hindwing pairs morphologically twowinged insects have a single pair of welldeveloped wings only the forewing pair is present in dipterous flies muscida some syntomidae papilionida tiny wasps vespida mymarommatidae mymaridae nemopteridae myrmeleontida scale insects cimicida coccoidea and some mayflies ephemerida remarkably these insects are often of small sizesmaller than the mean size characteristic of their groups in general for example morphologically twowinged mayflies are the smallest among all the ephemeropterans the same is true of the previously mentioned wasps and scale insects the order diptera in general also includes rather small insects 14 i form and fz n of insect wings many species possess only hindwings these include some beetles scarabaeida staphylinidae cetoniinae twistedwing parasites stylopida some walking sticks phasmatida mole crickets gryllida gryllotalpidae pygmy grasshoppers gryllida tetrigidae pygmy mole crickets gryllida tridactylidae and earwigs forficulida among the insects that have four true wings functionally two and fourwinged forms are recognized most functionally twowinged species possess fore and hindwings connected as two couples during flight each couple operates as a single wing this condition is typical of many taxa including the cimicida and most of the phryganeida papilionida and vespida several functionally twowinged species are characterized by four unpaired wings that all remain open during flight nevertheless flapping is performed by only one of the two wing pairs thus some diurnal butterflies papilionida papilionidae parides neophilus papilio spp ornithoptera spp can fly with immovable hindwings so that all the aerodynamic force necessary for flight is generated by the forewings which work at frequency values that are unusually high for butterflies 25 strokes per second remarkably these butterflies are also able to fly in the usual lepidopteran manner with paired wings grodnitsky et al 1994 operating the wings at highfrequency values is energetically more expensive pennycuick 1975 at the same time neither the thorax construction the musculature nor the wing articulations of these butterflies are adapted to work at frequencies higher than 515hz this functional modification clearly maladaptive for flight can be explained in the following way the functionally twowinged papilionids are unpalatable with hindwings bearing brightly colored warning spots the butterflies are most vulnerable to predators when they are gathering nectar and flitting from flower to flower to avoid attacks these butterflies keep their hind wings fully open and stationary so that the bright pattern is clearly seen thus the butterflies use extra energy but enhance their chances for survival grodnitsky et al 1994 tiger beetles scarabaeida carabidae cicindelinae provide an example of functionally twowinged insects that fly with the help of their hindwings in flight their elytra are open fixed and supported from below by the forelegs and middle legs schneider 1975 grodnitsky and morozov 1994 the same kinematics also can be observed rarely in maneuvering dragonflies riippell1989 the fore and hind wing pairs of functionally fourwinged insects flap relatively independently of each other in the majority of species the fore and classification of insects and their wingbeat r1ilematics i 15 hind wings display inphase kinematics producing a phase shift that is either constant or changing in accordance to a definite law and is short in comparison with the entire stroke cycle normally the stroke amplitude is considerably larger in the hindwings than in the forewings functionally fourwinged anteromotoric with leading forewings inphase kinematics is characteristic of scorpionflies panorpida lacewings myrmeleontida primitive moths papilionida micropterigidae eriocraniidae primitive caddisflies phryganeida rhyacophilidae and stoneflies perlida ellington 1984 grodnitsky and kozlov 1985 ivanov 1985a brackenbury 1992 1994 grodnitsky and morozov 1992 t994 at the beginning of the stroke the hindwings of these insects follow the forewings then outrun them approximately in the middle of the downstroke and finally returning in the upstroke meet the forewing pair at the highest point of the trajectory to start a new working cycle note however that the inclusion of stoneflies in this group is somewhat problematic according to brodsky 1982 1985 1986a the stoneflies isogenus nubecula newm and allonarcys sacchalina klap are anteromotoric whereas taeniopteryx nebulosa l and isoptena serricornis pict are posteromotoric this may explain why brodsky 1988 1994 designated stonefly strokes as quasisynchronous nevertheless the other two perlida species are evidently anteromotoric see fig 32b grodnitsky and morozov 1994 this kinematic type is presumably also specific to webspinners embiida snakeflies raphidiida and alderflies corydalida anteromotoric strokes also may occur rarely in dragonflies riippell1989 sato and azuma 1997 inphase flappers that begin strokes with their hindwings are called posteromotoric they include dragonflies libellulida most grasshoppers crickets and mantids gryllida and in all likelihood cockroaches blattida while flying their hindwings are permanently leading pringle 1957 neville 1960 zarnack 1983 alexander 1984 kammer 1985 schwenne 1990 brackenbury 1990 1991a 1992 robertson and reye 1992 robertson and johnson 1993 wortmann and zarnack 1993 the wingbeat kinematics of beetles is somewhat different nevertheless it should be classified as inphase functionally fourwinged with a leading hind pair although all the wings begin the stroke cycle almost simultaneously in the majority of the beetles the stroke amplitude of the elytra is strongly reduced and does not exceed 3060 schneider 1975 grodnitsky and morozov 1994 a peculiar type of functionally fourwinged kinematics has been observed 16 i for 4 function of insect wings in anisopterous dragonflies their fore and hindwings perform antiphase strokes phase shift equals approximately a halfcycle chadwick 1940 neville 1960 norberg 1975 alexander 1984 riippell1989 contrary to the previous pattern the hindwings begin to move from the lowest point of their trajectory when the forewings start from the top and vice versa this flight mode is related to particular behavioral responses the same insects are capable of inphase flight as well the selection factors that channeled the evolution of the diversity of insect flapping flight are unclear and have not yet been widely discussed a causal explanation for the origination of the main kinematic modes is based on the results of comparative studies of the vorticity generated by insect wings during flight data on vorticity created during the stroke cycle are presented in chapter 2 and an evolutionary scenario of flight change is discussed in chapter 3 2 wingbeats and vorticity the principal function of wings is flight therefore a functional assessment of the morphology and evolution of insect wings initially requires insight into the mechanisms of aerial locomotion this chapter examines the major phenomena that occur in the air near a flying insect and correlates these phenomena with the principles of force generation that have been suggested for insect flapping flight before describing insect flight dynamics it is necessary to give a brief account of how the wings move and to explain the conventional ways in which force sufficient for flight is created 21 general points of wing movement and deformation in an insectbound coordinate grid the wing tip trajectory reveals a closed loop of various curvatures and shapes that may change according to flight situation the upstroke trajectory is normally behind the downstroke path as a first approximation the wings can be considered to move in a plane containing the wing hinge this plane is called the stroke plane it is perpendicular to the longitudinal body axis in many species and is inclined to the body axis at an angle of 3060 in others fig 21a b while hovering the stroke plane is often close to horizontal ellington 1984 the stroke cycle begins at the start of downward wing movement from the highest point of the wing trajectory according to relevant literature pringle 1957 weisfogh 1973 ellington 1984 kammer 1985 betts 1986a wootton 1990 and original data the wingbeat cycle is quite similar in very different insects the main feature of the wing stroke during the forward flight of all volant animals is its iil1etry lighthill1969 spedding 1992 which is necessary to

parts of stroke cycle d relation between downstroke td and ated owing to a difference in airspeeds over and under the wing the force is positive if the airspeed is greater above the wing than below it during downstroke and negative when the opposite occurs normally during upstroke the asymmetry of strokes in flapping flight is required to make the value of the positive lift larger than that of the negative so that the difference between downstroke and upstroke impact is positive and sufficient for flight alexander 1968 cloupeau et al 1979 nachtigall1985 brodsky 1988 sunada et al 1993a the stroke cycle is asymmetric in several respects first the downstroke is normally incomplete because the wings do not touch in the lower part of their trajectory thus the lower portion of the stroke is much shorter than the upper part fig 21c second the downstroke usually lasts longer than the upstroke fig 21d so the downstroketoupstroke duration ration although variable cannot be less than 1 third

the rotation of the leading edge downward takes place near the uppermost point of the trajectory and is called pronation upward leadingedge rotation is called supination and is observed near the lowest point of the stroke cycle fig 21f typically pronation begins before and stops after the wings have passed the highest point the same is true of supination in relation to the lowest point fig 21g an inclined stroke plane appears as a secondary feature in many unrelated insect orders it strengthens the stroke asymmetry because in straight flight the wing airspeed and corresponding generated force are significantly increased during the downstroke and diminished in the upstroke wootton 1990 20 i form ana tion of insect wings in both extreme trajectory points during wing rotation a peculiar movement termed swingingedge mechanism can be observed nachtigall1979 1985 zanker 1990a grodnitsky and morozov 1994 instead of changing the angle of attack monotonically the wing first performs a redundant rotation through a turn considerably greater than necessary to achieve the angle of attack required for the forthcoming downstroke next the wing turns in the opposite direction and achieves the angle of attack that is kept approximately constant during the further halfstroke fig 21h the wings of all flying insects display similar features of deformation during the stroke cycle wootton 1981 during most of the cycle the wings are slightly cambered being almost flat fig 22a in species with a second arily enlarged anojugal zone the hindwings assume the shape of a gutter j directed backward or backward and aside in broadwinged species mantids grasshoppers and butterflies brackenbury 1990 1991a 1992 wootton 1995 a slightly convex wing profile can be observed insects with wings of usual width only occasionally demonstrate a convex profile grodnitsky and morozov 1994 because of their construction insect wings are much more deformable during supination than pronation ennos 1988

and functions at this point it is sufficient to state that there are generally two lines of deformation on both the fore and the hindwing in generalized insects one of the deformation lines is stretched along the remigial zone of the wing near the median vein in many specialized forms the vein is lost whereas the deformation line is retained another line lies on the border between the remigium and the clavus also in insects with coupled fore and hind wings the zone of wing joint may occasionally serve as a concave deformation line fig 22 wingbeats aid vorticity i 21 a b figure 22

limited by physical requirements and is thus definitely less diverse than terrestrial locomotion the main principles of force generation have much in common in all flying and swimming animals and were considered in several general reviews of animal aerial and aquatic locomotion kokshaysky 1974 ellington 1984 1995 rayner 1986 spedding 1992 dudley 1992 1999 dickinson 1996 advances in the field of biomechanics of natural locomotion in fluids can be attributed in large part to the welldeveloped theory of flying and swimming of manmade vehicles although this theory is unable to explain all the

triangles mark the upper surface of the wing leading edge it clearly facilitates research suggesting various mechanisms for useful force generation let us consider aircraft aerodynamics because of a positive angle of at ecteirq oniter ide this results in two flows one coming from the leading the other from the trailing edge as the flows meet they separate from the wing surface and curl up forming a vortex fig 23a next the point of separation of the flow initially located between the leading and trailing edges shifts backward with the growth of magnitude and rotation velocity of the vortex wingbeatslnd vorticity i 23 above the wing fig 23b this process culminates when the point of separation coincides with the trailing edge and a starting vortex is generated fig 23c from this moment on air moves about the wing without separation faster above the wing and slower below it the growth period of the starting vortex is accompanied by an increase in aerodynamic force applied to the wing its vertical component called lift a measure of the difference of airspeeds above and below the wing is called circulation it can be represented in an abstract way as if a bound vortex rotates around the wing accelerating air over and decelerating it under the wing fig 23d ideally the respective momenta of the starting and bound vortices are equal circulation continues around the wing during flight and departs from the wing at landing at which time a stopping vortex is formed that rotates in the direction opposite to the starting one fig 23 the starting and stopping vortices form the vortex wake of flying aircraft in animals the force necessary to fly is generated as wings accelerate the surrounding air as the wings do this they are said to be aerodynamically active or efficient the resulting air movement constitutes a vortex wake analogous to that of an aircraft because wake shapes reveal peculiarities of mechanisms of force generation studies of vorticity are given priority in the aeromechanics of aerial locomotion and have in fact defined the main success achieved by this science during the last decade hummel and goslow 1991 rayner 1991 ellington 1995 data have been

of vortex wakes a vortex tube consists of a cylindershaped space volume in which a rotatory air movement takes place ideally the air rotates in the direction tangential to the cylinder surface a vortex tube cannot end in air and must be closed either to a solid surface eg a wing or to itself in the latter case a selfclosed loop called a vortex ring is generated fig 24 the ring has two axes of symmetry central fig 24a and circular fig 24b a planar section of the vortex tube reveals a vortex fig 24b thus the vortex is a 24 i form a nction of insect wings a figure 24 vortex ring a and its section b by plane containing central symmetry axis cena of the ring v twodimensional vortex cira circular axis of symmetry twodimensional structure whereas the tube and ring are threedimensional since flow rate and pressure in liquid and gas are inversely proportional vorticit rejr_z_low_eessue the threedimensional structure of the vortex wake reflects the main difference between animal flapping flight and the flight of manmade aircraft kokshaysky 1974 in an airplane the starting vortex constitutes a cross section of the starting vortex tube also called the starting bubble generated close to the trailing edge and stretched from one tip of the wing to the other fig 25a after the aircraft has passed a distance equal to several wing chords saffmatl l the bubble separates from the trailing edge and stays behind the wing so that only a pair of vortex tubes remain attached to the tips fig 25b prandtl and tietjens 1957 cross sections of these tubes are called tip vortices while decelerating the wing generates a stopping vortex bubble fig 25c as a result an aircraft produces a single infinitely stretched vortex ring from the beginning to the completion of its flight the aerodynamic force necessary to fly is created entirely from the bound vortex __1a i n l ___d oo e figure 25 threedimensional structure of vortex wake behind aircraft plane ac and flapping insect d e a

couple in functionally twowinged species also generates a sex tube fig 250 after a short time before the wings positional angle reaches 60 these two tules merge_ate_ing_llhaped bubble analogous to the starting bubble of an aircraft fig 25e ellington 1995 termed this bubble the comzined32rtx at the bottom of their trajectory the wings decelerate and swing around this movement produces a st9jelflg_y2tx tube that together with the ushaped bubble forms a losed vrtex ring because the upstroke is also aerodynamically active tip vortices come from the wings during this stroke period these tip_vorti_merggj1_t9hs ridggttajicl g9_o_qs1roke so that no new independent vortices are formed in the upstroke the following stroke cycle generates another vortex ring thus the entire aerodynamic wake of a flying insect consists of a series of mutually parallel rings ellington 1980 1984 grodnitsky and morozov 1992 1993 1995 grod 1996 independent of a kinematic pattern of the wings this is the simplest scheme of instroke vortex dynamics as will be shown further different aerodynamic phenomena can take place in insect flight and the resulting shape of the wake can be quite varied nevertheless the most important idea to be understood at this point is that in respect to the generated vorticity the doyllirtill9jiespqndsto thebtr flightperiqdin_rurcraft this correspondence is the most consistent characteristic of natural flapping flight in aircraft the starting vortex remains far behind the wing after the initial stage of movement thus it does not affect the forces generated by the aircraft wings on the other hand in insects the starting vortex is produced many times within each second of flight at least at the initial stroke phase the starting vortex is located close to the body and wings owing to this proximity it can influence the process of force generation as theory predicts and experiments demonstrate the presepce_of a vortexllublili_near a wing_jts_in

its interaction with the region of the vortex wake closest to it these interactions can be quite diverse see brodsky 1994 e11ingtqill295 ellingletalj996 wj997 uldrkku968 suggested that flying and

this method represent sections made by the light plane in the threedimensional vortex flow because the images of only those dust particles located in the beam plane at the moment of frame exposure are fixed on film by changing the position of the beam relative to the insect one can obtain pictures of the flow in various parts of the surrounding space during different phases of the stroke cycle sixteen different light plane positions were used in five aspects lateral frontal frontaside and topaside fig 27 afterward the threedimensional flow structure was reconstructed from the twodimensional representations and its stroke cycle dynamics was described in this technique the photographs do not record the central part of the vortices because dust is thrown away from the area of rotational air motion the method described permits the study of flow only about insects with a relatively low wingbeat frequency because high frequencies increase the speed of the ambient air with a corresponding

the study of natural flight needs additional support a tethered specimen cannot be used to evaluate the correlation between its weight and generated aerodynamic force the information perceived by its visual and windsensitive organs is far from natural and its center of gravity which normally undergoes periodical vertical oscillations is immovable therefore it is of course preferable to study free

operation of musculature nervous ganglia and nerves as well as the vorticity around body and wings only a few studies of this type have been published being carried out on single species khetalj223 grodutikl1996 however these studies did not contribute considerably to the existing understanding of flapping flight therefore tethered flight will remain one of the primary technical approaches in this field it is necessary recognizing the constraints imposed by tethering to try to define the relationship of the experimental results to natural phenomena wingbeat frequency in tethered flight is generally less than that of insects in free flight baker et al 1981 kutsch and stevenson 1981 feller and nachtigall 1989 grodnitsky 1992a and even at similar wingbeat frequencies tethered specimens generate less thrust gewecke 1983 thrust production is probably reduced because the wings in tethered specimens perform almost harmonic strokes tdtu close to 1 grodnitsky 1992a whereas the downstroketoupstroke ratio in freeflying insects always exceeds 1 ellingtonj284 betts and wootton 1988 owing to the difference of kinematic parameters tethered flying insects often do not

hollick 1940 heisenberg and wolf 1979 ellington 1984 zanker 1990b it is essential that different insects react to various experimental conditions in different ways for instance in locusts a socalled litmntrol reaciliw has been described gettrup and wilson 1964 gettrup 1965 in which the tethered flying specimen keeps the generated lift constant irrespective of the angle between its body and horizontal body angle at the expense of changes in wingbeat kinematics in several other studied species by contrast arbitrary variation of the body angle does not affect the angle between the longitudinal body axis and stroke plane nor the general shape of the wing tip path fig 29 any change of the flying specimens body angle results in a corresponding change of its weight force with which it affects the tether the curve describing the dependence of vertical force on the angle of inclination of stroke plane to horizontal stroke plane angle resembles a sinusoid fig 210 this indicates a lack of the liftcontrol reaction and shows that rotation in the sagittal plane does not influence the angle between the stroke 1 1 wingbeats llweight 160 120 i j 08 spa i 04 02 20 40 60 80 04

aerodynamic force maximum lift generated by tethered insects can exceed the weight of the individuals when lift values approximated the weight of the experimental specimens their body angles were close to those observed in the same species during natural flight 3050 therefore while it can be concluded that experimental conditions disturb wingbeat kinematics it can also be inferred that this disturbance is not strong because the generated force is comparable with the force necessary for free flight on the other hand some data indicate an absence of significant differences between free and

situations the same qualitative patterns of wing profile change take place comparison of vortices generated around insects in free and in tethered flight grodnitsky and morozov 1993 grodnitsky and dudley 1996 also shows that the data generally coincide because vortex size and stroke mo wingbeaild vorticity i 35 tion relative to the body are similar it should be mentioned however that the natural phenomenon is more diverse than its experimental approximation thus in free specimens single strokes of low amplitude lead to the appearance of a separate vortex wake after each wing pair in tethered flight double wakes never occur since the wingbeat amplitude is often even higher than in freeflying specimens grodnitsky 1992a the final impression is that the differences between free and tethered flight of insects are not connected with flight as a physical phenomenon but rather reflect the behavioral reactions of specimens to the unnatural conditions of the experiment consequently the least cooperative tethered insects are those that have complex behavioral repertoires dragonflies bees and wasps and butterflies except skippers accordingly kinematic modifications can cause shifts in the relationships between particular phases of the stroke cycle and in corresponding changes in quantitative correlation between aerodynamic processes which take place during these phases the qualitative essence of the phenomenon however remains basically unchanged in any case the researcher has an opportunity to choose among the entire diversity of insect behavioral reactions and to experiment with species in which tethered flight approximates the natural phenomenon overall it can be concluded that presently there are no data demonstrating the impossibility of the investigation of qualitative aspects of insect flight on tethered specimens and that studies of tethered flight provide a reasonable approximation of natural aerial locomotion from the considerations presented in the foregoing one should not conclude that studies of insect flapping flight must be restricted purely to tethered flight research instead a combination of diverse methods of investigation is desirable within the limits defined by the nature of the particular flight aspect under study 24 vorticity in the flight of morphologically and functionally twowinged insects for any newly investigated problem disagreements are more natural than consensus the description of the aerodynamic processes that take place during active flight of insects is no exception this is especially true because the threedimensional wake structure is rarely observed directly but instead is reconstructed and therefore it should be treated as hypothesis rather than fact the latter circumstance causes

simple case on morphologically and functionally twowinged insects dipterous flieslepidopterans hymenopterans and insects the stroke cycle begins with the motion of wings downward from the highest point of their trajectory when the trailing edges begin to move away from each other starting vortex tubes are formed over them in bugs and dipterous flies flow_1fnd_9pjlnqlisgl2i_qf startingycutices is seen along the entire length of the trailing edges fig 212a two bubbles are formed closed to the forewing tips by their distal ends the proximal ends of the bubbles are closed to the trailing edges at the beginning of departure of the wings the diameter of the transverse section and wingbec j l l d vorticity i 37 the rotation speed of the tubes are not uniform voljices near the body are weaker whereas the most intensive vortex generation occus near the epidly moving distal parts of the yjngs as the wing speed increases the starting tubes grow in size and rotate more rapidly they elongate simultaneously and their proximal ends shift along the trailing edges toward the insect body consequently the tubes approach dtoge forming a single ushaped vortex bubble over the body of the flying insect the bubble is closed by its ends to the tips of the forewings fig 212b c in all likelihood this occurs when the wings achieve a positional angle between 45 and 60 after the bubble has been formed the distribution of internal vorticity becomes more uniform as a result longitudinal sagittal sections of the flow reveal a large dorsal vortex fig 213 the ushaped bubble accelerates air over the body of the insect directing it backward the described events of formation of starting tubes fig 212a has not been found in butterflies and moths unlike those of other studied insects lepidopteran wings tightly touch each other over the body at the beginning of the stroke cycle this seems to be connected with the specificity of lepidopteran kinematics in the beginning of the stroke see chap 3 motion of the wings in these insects is accompanied by the gradual departure of the trailing edges which are separated in a manner analogous to a zipper so that the point of connection of the right and left wings glides along the trailing edge toward the insect abdomen this motion was termed by ellington 1984 pl permits the starting h1hes generated by the left and right wings or wing couples to merge earlj in the stroke cycle in butterflies and moths the formation of a ushaped vortex bubble presumably occurs at the very beginning of the cycle a similar pattern is observed in caddisflies which have wing morphology and starting stroke kinematics similar to moths ivanov 1990 in lepidopterans and bugs the flow created by the wings brings the ububble backward as the first half of the working cycle continues consequently at the end of the halfstroke the dorsal vortex is no longer over the body but is located instead above the tip of the abdomen fig 212c at an equivalent time in dipterous flies the dorsal vortex retains its initial position approximately over the wing hinges fig 212d hence it can be concluded that the ububble is not brought backward in these insects in all investigated species supination at the end of the first and at the beginning of the second halfstroke results in clearly visible airflow thrownoff the 4frsal wing su_e fig 214 the observed pattern

designated fauike thro1jcjlif grodnitsky and morozov 1993 this effect has been seen in all the insect species studied the supinational turn of the wings begins before and finishes after the second halfstroke begins because the downward motion of the trailing edge proceeds after the wing tips start moving upward since the aerodynamic processes tha determine the flow character of the ing take place neqt the trailing edges the flow picture typical of the second halfstroke is observed not just after the beginning of the upstroke but somewhat later after the end of supination in fact downstroke appears to be longer for trailing edges than for wing tips therefore the borderline between the first and second halfstrokes should be confined to the tlailing eds not to the wing tips movement reversal as a result separation of the stgpping vortex tubes from the trailing edges is delayed and arises after the beginning of the upstroke coinciding in time with the end of the fanlike throwoff the stqpping tubes are locat beneath the wings their proximal ends close to the trailing edges and their distal ends to the wing tips consequently 40 i form and f jn of insect wings figure

the air is thrown away from the lower surfaces of the wings rather than from the space between them this can be seen only in dorsal views with a horizontal light plane not in the lateral views used in the previously cited articles in addition the formation of a tunnel is impossible unless the left and right wings clap at the upper part of their trajectory which is a relatively rare type of kinematics in insects see chap 3 by contrast fanlike throwoff does not require that the wings meet over the body the flpill from khr9flr_ngs the cjet_e_lejfslqsgjf_qftexjjng fig 212f balyjlrd so that the ring lgsiflictiqluyitblhwings the backward travel of the ring provides room for the formation of new starting tubes at the beginning of the following stroke the aerodynamic significance of fanlike throwoff has never been discussed and numerically modeled so it is unclear to what extent it contributes to the resultant aerodynamic force generated while flying and whether it is a separate aerodynamic phenomenon or simply a wing movement that enhances circulation such as the swingingedge mechanism however a strong flow occurs in consequence with the throwoff and thus flying specimens

grodnitsky and morozov 1993 in a tethered crane fly the vortex ring doses quite late when the wings approach each other at the end of the stroke cycle fig 212h then the entire ring can be found over the insect so that the ventral vortex is situated not under but over the body it is difficult to determine to what extent this result reflects the structure of the aerodynamic wake of the crane fly in natural flight in a natural situation it is possible that the ring closes over the body as determined experimentally owing to the specific shape of the crane fly wings however in several cases the ring was observed to close above the body of insects with broad wing hinges for example of noctuid moths grodnitsky and morozov 1993 with respect to these findings it is easier to believe that transfer of the ventral vortex onto the dorsal side results instead from a stroke with incom1 plete amplitude when the wings open to the positional angle of 90100 or less possibly the stopping tubes merge under the abdomen during the normal flight of crane flies as they do in other insects dickinson and gotz 1996 described another behavioral modification of the ventral tubes in drosophila they demonstrated that during upstroke the tubes fuse neither under nor over the body but remain attached to the fly body until the stroke cycle is finished in the course of supination the ventral tubes detach from the tip of the abdomen fuse and thus form a selfclosed strongly curved vortex loop note however that the flow passing through the loop is structured thermoanemometry procedure indicates three flow corridors inside it all parallel to the longitudinal body axis one located above the insect and two at the sides the three corridors meet unite and form a single roundsectioned flow 5 mm

kinematic patterns according to schneider 1975 and the data of grodnitsky and morozov 1994 the scarabaeida possess three main types of flight 1 the elytra do not open and do not contribute to forces necessary for flight this state is morphologic twowingedness 2 the elytra open and perform strokes at comparatively low 3050 amplitude this is functional fourwingedness with leading hindwings 3 the elytra open and remain immobile throughout the entire flight functional twowingedness with uncoupled wings in the first case the beetles can be assumed to have flight aerodynamics similar to other morphologically twowinged insects in this section data on the vortex wakes of beetles of the second and third types are presented the soldier beetle cantharis sp and the tiger beetle cicindela restricta represent these respective flight types during the period of each wing stroke cycle generation and development of vortex structures are observed when the wings move downward from the upper point of their trajectory at the beginning of the tiger beetle wing stroke a dorsal vortex emerges between them fig 216a indicating that circulation flow dominates around the wings this vortex constitutes a section across the ushaped vortex bubble located over the insect body and closed to the wing tips by its ends as the downstroke proceeds the diameter of the dorsal vortex increases fig 216b d judging from obtained photographs the rotational speed increases as well during the first halfstroke a gradual backward displacement of the dorsal vortex occurs so that the vortex is situated over the tip of the beetle abdomen during supination and reversal of wing motion this displacement is characteristic of all insects that do not possess secondarily narrowed wing hinges such as lacewings see sec 26 or crane flies see sec 24 the wings of the tiger beetles come close to each other under the abdomen during the course of supination owing to the high stroke amplitude the ends of the ushaped bubble closed to the wing tips approach each other as well in the bottom of the stroke or shortly after the ends of the ububble meet so that a complete selfclosed vortex ring appears at this moment a ventral vortex emerges on the flat sections of the flow rotating in the opposite direction to the dorsal vortex fig 217 resjlting from closure of the ushaped bubbleu11der the insect body 44 i form anc ction of insect wings figure 216 dorsal vortex above the body of tiger beetle at sequential moments ad during downstroke insect flying to the right during the entire second halfstroke the lower vortex is located under the beetle abdomen its diameter is noticeably less than that of the dorsal vortex fig 217 the caudal displacement of the dorsal vortex in the first halfstroke does not allow room for the formation of a separate ring during upstroke accordingly during part of the upstroke at least its lower half the wings move inside the vortex ring generated in the downstroke the ring travels backward as pronation starts and a new stroke cycle begins followed by the corresponding formation of new vortex structures fig 216a the formation of vortices near the elytra of the tiger beetle is not observed during the stroke cycle airflow around the elytra is smooth and does not separate from either the trailing or leading edges fig 216c d the general schemes of tiger beetle and soldier beetle vortex wakes do not differ substantially during each stroke dorsal and ventral vortices are formed over and under the body of cantharis fig 218 in the same manner as in cicindela this reflects the similarity of wake structure and suggests the formation of a single ring per stroke thus based on the available data the wingbeats a orticity i 45 figure 217 vortices above and under the body of tiger beetle during upstroke insect flying to the right aerodynamic wake of flying beetles is represented by a sequence of unlinked parallel rings as in other insects studied in this respect reduced strokes of the elytra do not change the schematic diagram of the wake the pictures of flow around the elytra of tiger beetles indicate that they do not create their own vortex structures this is possibly owing to their immobility or to the suction effect of flapping hind wings which causes rarefaction and thus prevents formation of separate vortex structures behind the elytra however a starting vortex behind the elytra at takeoff and a stopping vortex at landing must be produced then circulation flow can be established around the elytra accompanied by two tip vortices that come off the elytra tips and are accumulated by the nearest vortex ring if this occurs the immobile el ytra of tiger beetles perform anqlqgqllx_to__m sjrcgftjftinij s1jrface see fig 24c in this case the lift created by the elytra strongly depends on flight speed the higher the speed the more effective the lifting surface in hovering it is useless the latter assumption agrees well

from a great distance these beetles take off instantly and their flight is swift and in the majority of cases straight deceleration before landing is very rapid and imperceptible to the naked eye hovering or similar flight modes have never been observed and are most likely impossible moreover tiger beetles have obtained an accompanying set of morphologic features which justify the separation of cicindela and related genera into a family shwanvich 1949 borror et al 1992 in contrast to tiger beetles soldier beetles inhabit dense herbaceous vegetation their takeoff is comparatively slow while flying the soldier beetles often change direction performing turns at 180 and greater landing onto herb stems requires considerable accuracy and above all the capacity for slow horizontal or hoverin fli ht i have observed rather prolonged up to 1530 s natural hovering of soldier beetles this suggests that their elytra generate lift not only in fast flight ie owing to intensive work of the hindwings but also independently inducing their own flow during each stroke based on this finding one should anticipate that in the beginning of each stroke each elytron generates its own starting vortex however the vortex wake of soldier beetles contains no structures that could arise from the development of such vortices it can therefore be assumed that during each stroke cycle the starting vortices of the elytra merge with the more powerful upper ushaped bubble of the hindwings nevertheless not even vestiges of vortices have been observed near the trailing edges of elytra in the beginning of the stroke of soldier beetles most likely formation of the starting tubes is handicapped by a suction effect from the vortices of the hindwings this cannot prevent the establishment of circulation flow around the elytra because develment of the starting vortex is not the cause but rather a consegqence of thn as a result the impulse of the generated vortex equals the sum of circulations around the wings and elytra the presented data and considerations do not coincide with the early opinion of pringle 1963 who believed the elytra to be totally passive organs that oscillate only under the effect of vibration resulting from the use of the metathoracic musculature the data instead confirm the viewpoint that the elytra of beetles act solely as generators of lift

while the stroke cycle continues the tubes of all four wings accumulate the vorticity coming from the wings and increase in size and speed of rotation fig 220c d as flow speed increases around the wings the tubes elongate so that their proximal ends come closer to the body and finally unite with the tubes on the opposite side of the body owing to mutual attraction the tubes of the fore and hindwing pairs simultaneously merge and form a common ushaped vortex bubble situated over the insect body fig 219c d the section of this ushaped bubble by a sagittal plane is the dorsal vortex clearly

continue to move downward and therefore experience larger negative pressure than the forewings a similar phenomenon was described in anteromotoric functionally fourwinged caddisflies ivanov 1990 the beginning of the second halfstroke of the forewings is accompanied by the formation of stopping tubes which rotate in the opposite direction to the upper ushaped bubble fig 219f the stopping tubes of the left and right wings unite in the same manner as during the first half of the stroke cycle supination of the hindwings results in the formation of two more stopping tubes fig 219g subsequently all the vortices below the insect merge fig 219g this fusion is indicated by the presence of a single vortex under the abdomen of the insect fig 222 the upper and lower tubes unite into a single vortex ring via the wing tips fig 219h as in other insects see sec 24 the ring shape noticeably differs from a toroid so that frontal views reveal only the upper twothirds of the ring the lower part remains

similar conclusion can be derived from the shape of aerodynamic polar curves that correlate dynamic characteristics of a wing with its angle of attack polar curves as a rule do not indicate a dramatic reduction of lift after the wing achieves supercritical values of the angle of attack this suggests that the increase of this angle does not result in flow separation from the wings of most different

vortex vorticity generation at these re values is highly questionable even more so because the time to create the vortex is quite short about 2 x 103 s or less since the wingbeat frequency of drosophila in the experiments of dickinson and gotz 1996 was close to 200hz convincing data in support of the separation hypothesis were recently presented arguing that flow separates from the wings of live flapping insects after the fling movement is complete and the wings undergo downward translation ellingmu225 ellingtqn et al 1996 willmott et al 1997 flow separating from leading edges is clearly seen at high 18 mjs and greater flight speeds whereas it is much less evident at lower speeds the opinion of ellington willmott and their coworkers is that at low flight speeds the leadingedge vortex bubble is too small to be seen in smoke visualization photographs they also state that the bubble in principle cannot be registered under light plane illumination because the strong axial from hinge to tip that occurs durioke imparts a coniglsplalshapejo the 19ejll22k as a matter of fact any vort that develops during a stroke of flapping wings is srir the tip vortices are sj2iral as well owing to the progressive downward wing movement rather than the axial flow but they still can be detected easily in photographs fig 221b since the light plane width is not zero probably vorticity is absent on the leading edge of flying insects in hovering and slow forward flight showing a difference between live specimens and artificial models this difference has been attributed to two properties of insectan wings the first suggestion reflects the fact that the surface anllijnsect wingbeats 1 add vorticity i 57 winga_ are covered with microscoeic structujes hairs spines scales etc vogel 96zb an approximate calculation according to prandtls formula 19 cjte9 ia vqgell962 shows that superficial microstructures do not project outside the boundary layer and hence do not interact with free flow grodnitsky et al 1988 see also bocharovamessner 1979a note however that prandtls boundarylayer equation is applicable to conditions of stationary flow when the speed and direction of flow are unchanged in time this condition is unfulfilled in insect flight nonetheless although formulas for calculation of the boundary layer on a flapping wing do not currently exist the thi_skness gf the layer must be the same as or greater than on a stationary lifting surface of the same shape because the development of flow and establishment of minimum boundarylayer thickness can demand a greater ime period than the stroke cycle allows thus according to rough quantitative data microstructures do not interact with free flow however they still can somehow affect the boundary layer and preyent separation vogel1962 the mechanisms of such an effect can differ on the wing surface micrqscopic appendages are assembled in particular comblike structures that can cut the boundary layer into microtlows bocharovamessner 1979a 1982 and make them turbulent zakharenkov et al 1975 it is also possible that spinand scales simply increase the total win and cqrrespondingly tbejmface of tlu ontact hetween the wing aud boundary layer thereby resulting in a decrease in tliil tlow inside the layat and preventing separation if the microstructures are able to prevent separation they probably do so only in a limited range of flow speeds near the wings this is suggested by data on flow separation from the wings of a large hawkmoth in fast flight ellington 1995 ellington et al 1996 willmott et al 1997 the trailing edge provides another counterargument this region normally bears much more highly developed microstructures than the leading edge yet they do not prevent flow separation it is admittedly conceivable that separation from this part of the wing is induced by the difference of pressure that originates after fling but is absent in the very beginning of the stroke cycle the second reason suggested for nonseparating flow around the leading wing edge in a limited range of flow speeds is the flibilitx qf insect willgs they are elastic structures and bend toward the opposing wind during fling the flexible fling modification is designated by the termjj1j ellington 1984 this viewpoint also encounters contradictions more specifically the lack of vortex formation near the rigid elytra of bugs and beetles my personal opin 58 i f1 1d function of insect wings ion is that separation of flow is not produced by the leading edges of insect wings primarily because of the smll

above the see sec 24 the discussion of problems involving analytical description of the aeromechanics of insect flight is beyond my professional ability however it is necessary to note several points that could be important for the numerical description of the flapping flight of living beings recently the opinion predominates that the quasisteady approach to calculation of the wing force parameters through the representation of the stroke cycle as a series of steadystate conditions is an unrealistic simplification of animal flight which is instead predominantly based on unsteady effects so that an appropriate description of the natural phenomenon cannot be achieved in this way ellington 1984 1995 dudley and ellington 1990b spedding 1992 1993 ellington et al 1996 willmott et al 1997 more reliable vortex theories derive the force necessary for flight from the momentum that the wings transfer to air e7 1980 1984 ray1980 azurna_arulwaiqnaqe_ 1988 azwna 122f nevertheless comparison of available vortex theories with vortex impulse measurement data shows that the vortis approximately twofolan that demanded for free flight spedding et al 1984 5reclding 1992 based on these considerations the impulse shortage can be connected with the interaction of wings with the leadingedge vortex rl whereby it is generated andjor with the starting vortices another additional force can be created by pronation411lqon as the most simplified and generalized representation a stroke cycle can be imagined as a succession of different aerodynamic mechanisms it begins with a fling movement in large insects possibly accompanied by flow separation from the leading edges fling is followed by translation of the wings formation of starting vortices over the trailing edges and subsequent growth of circulation and the corresponding vertical force both the circulation and i the starting vortex can be enhanced by the swnism during downstroke the starting vortex locates near the wing influencing the entire flow field and accelerating air above the insect supination is accompanied by fanlike airflow coming off the upper side of the wing simultaneously wingbeats vorticity i 61 upstroke begins and the stopping vortex is formed always of a smaller size than the starting bubble after a while the vortices over and under the wing unite into a vortex ring the ring departs from the wings at the end of the upstroke under the effect of fanlike throwoff the varying nature of the processes that accompany the progress of the wingbeat cycle suggests that a different algorithm should be used to describe each phase of the stroke cycle 29 body motion during stroke cycle 291 motion of the pterothorax the aerodynamic significance of the phenomena that occur in the air within each stroke phase can be assessed according to the character of motion undergone by the insect body during the stroke phases to examine this problem the periodic vertical and horizontal oscillations that follow each stroke cycle were studied in freeflying butterflies of several north asiatic species of the family nymphalidae grodnitsky 1992a 1993 based on measurements of pterothoracic oscillations it was possible to ascertain the distribution of lift throughout an averaged stroke cycle according to cinematographic data a stroke cycle is divided into five phases fig 225 before the beginning of each stroke the wings tightly adjoin each other with their upper sides over the insect body immediately after beginning the fling movement takes place phase 1 followed by phase 2 translation when the wings move downward with an approximately constant angle of attack owing to a comparatively small frequency of framing the swingingedge movement was not separated into a single phase the stroke continues in phase 3 which coincides with supination phase 4 is the upstroke followed by pronation phase 5 during this final stage the wings approach and touch each other in a motion named clap weisfogh 1973 clap and fling compose two successive phases of pronation framebyframe analysis of cinematographic films provided an opportunity to plot histograms that reflect the withinstroke distribution of pterothorax motions fig 226a b it was found that in horizontal flight butterflies descended during the absolute majority of recorded claps and flings climbing was observed

enabled a graph to be plotted that reflects the character of vertical motion of the center of mass in each stroke phase at first approximation the curve has the shape of a sinusoid fig 226c the force that induces sinusoidal oscillations is proportional to the second derivative sinx sinx consequently withinstroke lift distribution is approximately described by an antiphase sinusoid which means that maximum lift oqurs during the downstrqke the maximum value of thrust cannot be correlated to any stroke phase because thrust is opposed by drag which is continuously changing in conjunction with flight speed pulsations by contrast in vertical oscillations the generated lift is counterbalanced by the weight of the insect which is constant and thus allows assumptions to be made about lift dynamics during stroke cycle a similar pattern of lift distribution throughout the stroke cycle was obtained from studies of the flight of the stable fly and dragonfly tethered to highly sensitive strain gauges that measured the vertical and horizontal forces acting on the body during flight b1281 sompsarulluttges 1285 according to these studies lift is close to zero at the beginning of the

cycle in freeflying butterflies and the measured lift distribution in the tethered fly suggests that aerodynamic force generation in these insects is realized according to the same principles one can also conclude that experimental tethering of insects does not change these principles excessively and that tethered flight therefore reflects the primary phenomena that accompany jfu natural flapping flight the reported data enable one to appreciate at first approximation how some of the processes in the air influence the overall balance of useful and parasitic forces that affect a flying insect in all likelihood fling initially described as a qualitatively novel aerodynamic adaptation to flapping flight lighthill 1973 weisfogh 1973 indeed favors fast growth of lift on the 64 i fo d function of insect wings other hand the chalcid wasp e formosa counterbalances its weight after rather than during fling since the descending part of the flight path is terminated within phase 2 a finding that contradicts the results of weisfoghs 1973 investigation of free flight in this species consequently fl_ing favors quick gro and constitutes a stage preparatory to the main part of downstroke when the wings create the force necessary for the insect to stay aloft bocharovamessner and aksiuk 1981 and other researchers betts and wgpttonj38 brods91 willmott et al 1997 believe that thrust can be partially generated owing to jt eff indeed as can be seen from the presented data phase 5 coincides with the interval of positive thrust values nevertheless this assumption in general appears doubtful for insects examination of the structure and dynamics of the flow around flying insects shows that the wings throw a volume of air backward in a fanlike manne during pronation corresponding to phases

the butterflys abdomen from the longitudinal axis of the thorax during the principal part of the stroke cycle the abdomen is kept in line with the pterothorax and deflects upward during supination when the wings achieve a positional angle of 130160 the amplitude of these deflections ranges between 10 and 30 in the species of butterflies investigated a changt flight direction was repeatedly observed in cases in which the aboonjiru_th the pterothorax at the end ofdq1nstroke throughout phase 3 the body of the butterfly acquired a more vertical position and after this the insect began to gain height the upward turn wasj quicker when the abdomen having declined upward earlier began to move in the same direction as the wings at the end of downstroke fig 227 stability of general flight

shows that maximum liftoccurs at theene ef phase 2 66 i form ar runction of insect wings phase one can therefore conclude that during horizontal flight most lift is created in downstroke and supination based on the data of wingbeat kinematics patterns of vorticity and instroke movements of the pterothorax and abdomen in general this is consistent with nachtigalls 1966 opinion on the distribution of forces within the stroke cycle small insects namely drosophila demonstrate wing kinematics different from large and mediumsized insects even from a larger blowfly phormia regina zanlserj22qa this is a probable basis for the difference of instroke force distribution found in drosophila and is discussed subsequently because the described mechanisms of force generation are inherently different depending on situation the relative contribution from each of them can be either increased or diminished for example in medijliilized and largeinsects the

dynamicswas reported for the first time the authors provide an interpretation based on an extreme form of wagners effect for more explanations see dickinson and gotz 1996 the exploitation of rotary mechanisms principally by small insects presumably has morphological consequences namely the origination of morphologically twowinged flight systems because the useof rn demands jebiluhwilgs prohibiiqyjliolhind and forewing and causing reduction of the latter hence morphologically twowinged insects are normally relatively small examples include mymarid wasps scale insects mayflies and the order muscida in general wingbeats and vorticity 210 i 67 the problem of flight power regulation while flying insects are able to regulate power output and change lift and flight velocity within wide limits information on their methods of doing this is surprisingly contradictory according to published data the nature of the relationship between flight speed and stroke frequency is quite ambiguous the direct dependence of speed on frequency has been reported for tethered gewecke and niehaus 1981 and freeflying sotavalta 1947 betts and wootton 1988 lepidopterans tethered gotz 1968 gewecke 1974

absence of such interrelationships in tethered flies vogel 1967a cullis and hargrove 1972 and freeflying butterflies grodnitsky 1993 and in dragonflies and damselflies wakeling and ellington 1997b reports on a correlation between speed and frequency are sometimes accompanied by data supporting different statements for example dependence is represented by a scattered cloud of dots baker et al 1981 contrary opinions have been suggested even for the same species for example housefly musca domestica cf cullis and hargrove 1972 and spiiler and heide 1978 a similar situation exists in bird flight research for example tsvelykh 1986 1988 komarov and mordvinov 1989 and mordvinov 1992 argue that flight speed increases with the increase of flapping frequency on the other hand there is a series of articles showing that flight speed varies noticeably at a relatively constant frequency greenewalt 1960 tucker 1966 schnell 1974 butler and woakes 1980 tobalske and dial1996 and the opposite that flight speed does not change under more frequent flaps pennycuick et al 1989 in nightingale and teal flying in a wind tunnel the frequency of wingbeats slightly but significantly increased over a particular minimum value at both an increase and a decrease of wind velocity pennycuick et al 1996 evidence also exists that separate flaps of the wings of the andean condor sometimes generate only thrust and sometimes only lift mcgahan 1973 in bats both the presence carpenter 1985 and absence aldridge 1986 of this relationship have been reported the information on the relationship between

direct correlation between flight speed and the downstroketoupstroke duration ratio has been reported several times based on the results of studies of freeflying butterflies betts and wootton 1988 grodnitsky 1992a and the coot komarov and mordvinov 1989 at the same time this correlation was found to be negative in freeflying hemipterans betts 1986c the pigeon and the magpie tobalske and dial1996 in freeflying bumblebees neither a positive nor a negative relationship was observed dudley and ellington 1990a horizontal flight speed as a rule is negatively correlated to the angle of body inclination to the horizon this is corroborated by numerous observations and experiments carried out on lepidopterans gewecke and niehaus 1981 dudley 1990 grodnitsky 1992a 1993 dipterous flies david

nevertheless some authors report an absence of interrelationships between flight speed and body angle in the tethered locust baker et al 1981 zarnack and wortmann 1989 in the majority of insect species body angle is intimately related with the angle between stroke plane and the horizon thus dependence of flight velocity on stroke plane angle must be of the same nature as the correlation between flight speed and body angle indeed flight speed directly changes with the stroke plane angle in freeflying dragonflies riippell 1989 dipterous flies ennos 1989a bumblebees dudley and ellington

is positive in the dragonfly m coerulatus riippell 1989 and negative in bugs betts 1986c increase of the downstroketoupstroke duration ratio makes a positive contribution to total lift in freeflying butterflies grodnitsky 1992a bugs betts 1986c and falco tinnunculus videler et al 1988 nevertheless it does not influence the lift value in migratory locusts baker and cooter 1979a in general there hardly exists a parameter of flapping flight that could be unequivocally correlated to the magnitude of lift and thrust generated by the wings during stroke cycle only wingbeat amplitude in most cases is directly related to lift contradictions in this field are so numerous and ubiquitous that they can be related to neither differences in experimental and observation procedures nor to the inaccuracy of researchers these disagreements are of a comprehensive character therefore they are likely to be caused by a single reason namely that numerous kinematic parameters participate in flight power regulation in insects and other flying animals besides the parameters previously discussed several more characteristics should be mentioned on which sufficient comparative data have not been reported these additional parameters include phase shift between the strokes of the fore and hindwings alexander 1984 somps and luttges 1985 riippell 1989 angle of attack vogel 1967a dudley and ellington 1990a parameters of the wing trajectory zanker 1988b wing deformation while flying ennos 1989a and ratio of the durations and angular amplitudes of pronation and supination ennos 1989a dudley and ellington 1990a flight power output can be regulated by changing the combination of particular values of these parameters whereas single parameters can have no direct dependence on the power output the complexity of functional relationships in the system of flight power regulation suggests that each insect species possesses several stable kinematic patterns each pattern is characterized by a definite combination of the parameters of wing and body motion and probably corresponds to the least energy loss at any given flight speed the patterns can also differ by the shape of the vortex wake formed behind a flying specimen rayner 1986 as wingbeaand vorticity i 71 one flight mode is being changed into another eg slow to fast horizontal flight separate parameters can be changing disproportionally to the flight speed change still the function that describes the changes of each parameter can be specific in relation to wing morphology and shape construction of the pterothorax and other morphologic features in all likelihood this may explain the current inability to derive a general conclusion on the mechanisms of flight power regulation by considering the flight of representatives of different volant animal groups an example corroborating the statement that simple linear correlations of kinematic parameters in insect flight power regulation systems should not be anticipated is given in an excellent recent article by lehmum and qickinsonj1997 who studied the correlation of stroke frequency and amplitude with the power generated in tethered flight of d melanogaster and managed to demonstrate that minimal force is produced at very different combinations of amplitude and frequency as the force increases the combinations become progressively less scattered finally the maximum force production corresponds to rather narrow intervals of both frequency and amplitude the entire cloud of dots marking the amplitudefrequency combinations has the shape of a spiral halfcoil with a sharp large power end and broad small power end as a result although stroke amplitude grows monotonically with power increase flight force is positively correlated with wingbeat frequency at low power output and negatively correlated at high output but at the same time the product of amplitude and frequency increases linearly with the force increase this scheme can vary in different insects chai and coworkers 1997 recently reported very similar though less detailed data for freeflying hummingbirds 211 the problem of vortex wake geometry the first successful attempt to visualize the flow around a tethered flying insect was that of demoll 1918 cited in rohdendorf 1949 who described a general picture of the flow around a hawkmoth averaged over a stroke cycle more recently use of thermoanemometers showed that during the course of a stroke cycle the field of velocities around flying insects is not constant but undergoes regular pulsations consistent with the frequency of strokes wood 1970 bennett 1976 current development of special methods provides an opportunity to study the nature of these pulsations and to describe the aerodynamic processes that follow the motion of the wings these data allowed 72 i for d function of insect wings quantitative tracing of the development of the velocity field throughout the wing working cycle and acquisition of information about some finer points of interactions between flapping wings and the air the aerodynamic wake of a flying insect can be divided into near and far regions the near wake contains vortex structures formed during the current stroke that interact with the body and wings the far wake includes vortices formed during past strokes which departed the flying specimen and do not directly interact with it 2111 near vortex wake generally at the beginning of a stroke each wing or wing couple generates a starting vortex tube closed by one end to the wing tip and by the other to the trailing edge as the wings move downward the single tubes enlarge and soon merge forming a single ushaped bubble closed to the wing tips after supination when the trailing edges pause to begin the upstroke the stopping vortex tubes are shed from the wings these tubes are connected to the upper ushaped bubble by their distal ends the proximal parts of the stopping tubes are closed to the trailing edges of flapping wings the stopping tubes merge with each other under the insect body during the upstroke as a result a complete selfclosed vortex ring is formed throughout the remaining part of the stroke cycle the riugd to jhwtgs and leaves_ilifm_quljllldrjhe effecloffanlikethrvyofggril1gpronation thus during each stroke the wings of a flying insect normally generate a single vortex ring in the process of its formation the ring can be far from toroidal in shape in addition different ring parts have different transverse diameters and in all likelihood different rotation speeds hence different parts of the ring are characterized by different impulse values that stem from the complex character of the wing motion and the short duration of the stroke cycle during downstroke vorticity is stronger owing to larger angles of attack in the course of upstroke this angle is considerably diminished with a consequent reduction in the intensity of vortex formation see also ellington et al 1996 and willmott et al 1997 next at the uppermost trajectory point the wings approach each other closely or mutually adjoin at the lowest point this normally is not achieved consequently stajtidg tubes mergeqmparatiylyeerly llreast1e stoppirtg bbbles connect relatively late hence the right and left starting vortices enhance each other whereas the stopping tubes are partially deprived of such opportunity and are decel wingbeats anti vorticity i 73 erated to a larger degree by the air viscosity that slows down rotation of the tubes the difference in strength between the starting and stopping tubes results in a pronounced uneven distribution of vorticity within the entire ring at the first stages of its existence visualization results show that the ring becomes more uniform and acquires a regular shape after losing its connection with the wings in addition the diameter of its circular axis essentially decreases compression of rings after the end of the stroke cycle was theoretically anticipated rayner 1979a and previously reported brodsky 1988 2112 far vortex wake presently three main models of the far wake of flying animals exist ander r men 1986 these models describe flight at different values of ad vance ratio j which represents the ratio of flight velocity to mean flapping velocity ellington 1984 the advance ratio also determines the wing path shape at high advance ratios the wing tip trajectory becomes elongated therefore at larger j the wing_can operate with positive angles of attack throughoutt11e entire stroke cycltifig 228a thereby preventing the formation of stopping tubes at the bottom of the trajectory if larger j values are accompanied by loy stroke amplityde when the wings of different sides do not meet each other above the body connection of the starting tubes does not taktplace and at any moment of the stroke the vortex wake is represented by two vortex cords or filaments coming from_qte wing tips a wake of such type is formed during the fast straight flight of birds rayner 1986 spedding 1987 bats rayner et al 1986 and insects willmott et al 1997 it differs from a typical aircraft wake see fig 25b by the spatial curvature of the tubes flapping flight with this kind of wake geometry is considered easier to analyze and model because nonstationary effects such as periodic interactions of the wings with evoked vorticity can be neglected in contrast to flight with the following two types of wake geometry robinson and luttges 1283 ohml90 send 1922 wings have negative angle of attack and generate

insect the second halfcycle possess zero angle of attak so th_at forces are not generated and yortices are not formed the spatial structure of the aerodynamic wake proposed in the section 2111 for hovering and slow forward flight differs from the model of linked rings which is more generally accepted in the descriptions of insect flight according to the material presented the wake consists of independent rings each of which is formed at the hindwings supination and completes its formation by the end of the stroke similar data were obtained for takeoff of the large white ellington 1980 and the tethered flight of fruit flies dickinson and gotz 1996 the conflicting interpretations of experimental data require additional argumentation for the suggested wake shape i propose that although wings are aerodynamically active throughout the upstroke and connected rings should therefore be anticipated sepqratexi lllear as the result of the wingbeat cycltry the model of separate rings is chosen because the cross section of a series of linked rings by a horizontal plane situated above or below the insect must inevitably present a pattern containing groups of four vortices brought together fig 229 this type of flow field has ieen repmtedby any of the researchers who defend the model of linked rings why are separate rings formed instead of connected ones first the left and right wings normally do not meet in the bottom of their trajectory consequently rings of sequential halfstrokes have a large common part that equals the entire lower ushaped bubble and represents up to onethird of the rings circular axis thus initially the rings of downstroke and upstroke are partially united this favors coalescence of the two rings in the course of the cur i 76 i form and tutction of insect wings b a c d figure 230 different wake types anticipated for free flight vortices are shown that are generated within one wingbeat cycle a vlikely connected rings at the end of upstroke b same after the beginning of the next stroke c separating rings d coalescing rings rent stroke as in fig 2300 in other words vortex filaments that come from the wing tips during upstroke are accumulated by the vortex ring generated in the course of downstroke this is supported by the results of a physical experiment jaxworthy 1972 showing that initially even completely separate rings have a tendency to merge contrary to theoretical predictions fabrikant 1964 roeta vortex rings do not assemble in groups and do not pass into one another as a result a single ring results from each stroke cycle second in insects with narrow wing hinges the dury_qrtex and hence the entire upper ushaped bubble dos notilie2itie body throughoulthewmkincxde therefore twoxiugs that could be formed during the first and second halfcycles are comhinedln lilce generation of two rings per stroke is prohibited by spatial limitations each ring has a relatively large crosssection diameter it is consequently impossible for two rings to simultaneously occupy the small space that the insect flies through during a single stroke separate rings provide the least controversial reconstruction of the wake spatial structure based on the data from visualization experiments however wingbeats andlrticity i 77 figure 231 left wing tip path of the blowfly calliphora erythrocephala in an independent coordinate system after nachtigal11985 in fast forward flight during downstroke the dorsal vortex moves away from the body to a distance sufficient for the formation of a separate ring of the second halfcycle as a result each stroke generates two vlike connected rings fig 230a b an analogous conclusion is derived from the results of smoke visualization of flow around the peacock butterfly brodsky 1990 1991 and the tobacco hawkmoth ellington et al 1996 willmott et al 1997 at high fligbjvelocity the rings part afterward fig 230c see willmott et al 1997 at loforward speed they 1xlxge fig 230d meanwhile formation of the wakes of such shape in free flight is not inevitable because the wing path relative to the air is such that the wing completes downstroke and begins upstroke practically in the same space fig 231 because sun compared with other stroke phases is te period when the body travels the least horizontal distance fig226b therefore for the entire lower part of the stroke cycle the wings move inside the zonr etheh ownmquced vortex flow thus prerequisites are created not for partitioning but for coalescence of the rings of downstroke and upstroke in hovering and in slow flight vortices of different strokes are not_sonnected with eachother segregation of the rings arises because the dorsal vortices of sequential strokes are separated in time and space having closed to itself a vortex tube forms a ring loses its connection with the wings and is carried away by the flow generated by fanlike air throwoff during pronation conversely new tubes begin to form between the upper sides of the wings only aftex thegreater parlqf_jm_llation when the insect has already flown a significant distance because pronation is the phase of the longest horizontal travel fig 226b finally any cycle of vortex formation has the same result despite kine 1 matic differences owing to various reasons the wake always appears as a series of separate rings as was presupposed by quantifiable models rayner 78 i fm td function of insect wings 1979a ellington 1980 1984 the most essential difference separating the proposed viewpoint from the existing vortex theories of insect flight is that the rings generated during natural flight cannot be considered as thin as is postulated in the cited articles measurement of the rings in free flight showed that the relationship between the diameter of the ring cross section and the diameter of the ring circular axis after the stroke cycle is finished varies from 018 to 038 and decreases when the ring is leaving the insect and its rotation is slowed down under the effect of air viscosity judging from visualization data the wake lasts approximately 01 s and then the vortex rings disappear 2113 double vortex chains according to brodskys 1985 1986b 1988 1991 assumption an increase in stroke frequency up to a critical value of about 70 hz leads to the formation of a separate vortex chain behind each wing this concept contains internal contradictions the presence of rings at each body side must induce an airflow over the tethered insect directed from the abdomen tip to the head however such a reversal has never been found grodnitsky and morozov 1993 theresults obtained indicate that the flow around crane flies see sec 24 does not bear the striking difference suggested by brodsky furthermore even after a considerable increase in stroke frequency up to 100120 hz in bugs and dipterous flies the wings generate only one vortex ring per stroke it can be assumed that the flow structure was interpreted as double chains because flow pictures taken from above contain two vortices on each side of a flying insect the conclusion of a single ring at each side of the body is quite evident and brodskys opinion is therefore understandable however a more detailed analysis of the vortex wake shows that a typical dorsal vortex is present over the body of the crane fly the double chains model does not include the dorsal vortex instead flow reversal must occur the data should be interpreted as though these vortices result from the crosssectioning of two strongly curved stopping tubes by a light plane so that the plane strikes each of the tubes twice fig 212g h accordingly the two tubes appear on photographs as four twodimensional vortices nevertheless the idea of double chains appears to be fruitful a wake of such shape is formed during some strokes of freeflying butterflies the formation of a separate vortex wake behind each wing or wing couple is possible if the right and left starting tubes do not merge above the body at the beginning of the stroke cycle that is if they have small rotation velocity wingbeats and vorticity i 7 and are separated by a space large enough to prevent the formation of a1 upper ushaped bubble this can happen if the wings move with a relative low speed performing incomplete strokes and do not approach each othe1 closely in the upper part of their trajectory in this case stagnation of dusl particles is seen in the space between the two vortex rings exactly as the specific character of the discussed model requires in tethered flight in still ail the stagnation is expressed as a flow reversal however the reason for the formation of a separate wake behind each flapping wingwing couple is not a strengthened stroke as was suggested by brodsky but just the opposite a weakened wingbeat modification with a reduced trajectory top grodnitsky and dudley 1996 dickinson 1996 suggests identical reasons for the formation of a double wake 212 conclusions examination of the phenomenon of insect flapping flight shows that one working cycle of the wings consists in a succession of different aerodynamic processes separated in space and time ci9jlation and interaction with the vortex wake take place during the wings translation whereas tling_and fanlike throwof follqw rotary movents pronation and supination the relative contribution from each mechanism to the resulting aerodynamic force is unknown but presumably can vary in insects of different size thus in mediumsized and large insects lift maximum coincides with the end of downstroke and supination whereas in small forms such as drosophila withinstroke lift distribution is different in all likelihood insects are able to gain energy from their own vortex wake controlling the interaction of wings and generated vortices the near vortex wake may therefore be represented as an accumulator that periodically takes and returns energy during the wingbeat cycle this statement complements common insight regarding cyclic accumulation of energy during flapping flight thus the concepts of weight borin and kokshaysky 1982 and eiastic boettiger and eurshpan 1952 weisfoh 19591 1960 1965 pringle 1963 wilson 1965 weisfogh aad andersen 1970 pfau 1973 1977 1985 1987 thomson and ihom12smi 1977 wisser and nachtigall 1983 ellington 1984 ill and ewing 1985 19ss bennetc1ark 1986 jiraos 1987 energy accumulators are augmented by the third one the wakenery accumulator the process of evolutionary formation of the cyclic system of energy accumulation can provide a field for special examination there is presently insufficient 80 i form and h ion of insect wings comparative material on this problem but strong controversies nonetheless exist thus elaboration of a general view on periodic energy storage in insect flying systems is currently impossible however the improvement of interactions between the wake and wings defined the main trends in the evolution of the flappingflight function in insects chapter 3 considers the evolution of flight in the insect orders 3 evolution of flight in the insect orders flight is not the only function of wings and their derivatives apart from their role in locomotion wings serve as defense organs are used to regulate body temperature and often carry diverse signal color patterns rohdendorf 1949 different wing functions may be incompatible with one another for example flapping flight is more economical with light wings whereas defense demands wings of greater mass the resulting adaptive complex reflects a st qf compromiles in which each function ii fulfilled only to the extent that it does not prevent tution oer rasnitsyn 1987 the evolution of flight in each order was influenced by specific preexisting or evolving features of construction andor mode of life the presence of a typical functional and morphologic environment also conditioned the typical course of flight function development therefore flight was improved in a peculiar manner in each order my own experience is based on studies of endopterygote insects cohors scarabaeiformes a group that embraces the main functional and structural diversity of flight systems

1992 31 the origin of flight the problem of the origin of insect flight is in fact the problem of the origin of insects themselves because the winged insects scarabaeona encompass the absolute majority of known recent and extinct species any theory that satisfactorily describes the origin of insect flight must provide answers to two basic questions 1 what were the primary structures from which wings originated and 2 what factor caused the initial increase in the wing precursor because the wings must be of sufficient size for active flight initially small vestiges could not perform as aerial propelling agents thus the initial function of winglets was definitely not flapping flight and flight origin instead constituted a typical case of function change see dohrn 1875 a search for the solution to the two essential questions has engendered numerous assumptions about the structure and functions of protowings most recently reviewed by kingsolver and koehl 1994 and dudley 1999 some authors believe that wings originated from articulated organs such as gills wigglesworth 1963 1973 1976 mamaev 1975 leech and cady 1994 marden and kramer 1994 1995 kramer and marden 1997 parts of gills birketsmith 1984 or similar structures carle 1982 respiratory appendages of legs kukalovapeck 1978 1983 1987 1991 1992 trueman 1990 averof and cohen 1997 prototergalia of body segments kliuge 1989 or spiracle valves bocharovamessner 1968 brodsky 1979b others consider wings to be derivatives of nonarticulated organs such as lateral paranotal martynov 1938 forbes 1943 shwanvich 1946 zalessky 1949 1953 hinton 1963 flower 1964 rasnitsyn 1976a 1981 wootton 1976 or posterolateral becker 1966 projections of the dorsal part of thoracic segments evolution of flight in the insect orders i 83 the evolutionary enlargement of wing vestiges could be caused by one of three reasons related to the mode of life of pterygote insect ancestors 1 the first winged insects were small the appendages favored passive transfer by wind wigglesworth 1963 1976 norberg 1972b some authors hypothesize that the original insects lived in arid and semiarid conditions in which heat convection caused strong elevating air currents to flow at up to several meters per second rainey 1965 2 the appendages helped to run performing fast flaps shwanvich 1946 kukalovapeck 1987 or balancing movements brodsky 1979b or they served for skimming on the water surface functioning first passively without strokes as sails under wind marden and kramer 1995 and then becoming active flapping organs of aerodynamic propulsion marden and kramer 1994 3 the first pterygota often jumped from elevations and then flew by gliding the appendages potentially extended the flight range snodgrass 1935 martynov 1938 forbes 1943 hamilton 1971 rasnitsyn 1976a 1980 wootton 1976 wootton and ellington 1991 in comparing these viewpoints three important facts should be mentioned first there are no paleontologic data indicating that the primitive insects that evolved into pterygotes were small rather they were mediumsized or even large rohdendorf and rasnitsyn 1980 second organisms with six legs do not need balancing when they run emelianov and falkovich 1989 moreover balancing movements as opposed to flapping are always directed contrary lefttoright third the life mode of many generalized recent insects including many apterygotes mayflies dragonflies stoneflies alderflies caddisflies primitive beetles and dipterous flies is closely connected with water tikhomirova 1991 the aquatic habits of these extant insects is one of the main reasons for the assumption that primary insects lived in water nevertheless the ancestors of pterygote insects evidently were neither aquatic nor semiaquatic they had descended from an aquatic myriapodlike ancestor but underwent further evolution in terrestrial habitats rohdendorf and rasnitsyn 1980 this view is supported by the absence of any paleontologic data indicating an aquatic life mode of the first insects even the primitive libellulida are thought to have terrestrial nymphs since no one fossil nymph is known from the carboniferous lakes whereas lots of imago have been found in general insect nymphs with definite adaptations 84 i form ar unction of insect wings to life in water appeared only in the permian era rohdendorf and rasnitsyn 1980 however the crucial fact is that all recent and extinct aquatic insects breathe with tracheal gills which are a secondary adaptation to life in water because the primary tracheal system was constructed for air breathing ghiliarov 1949 1957 becker 1952 tikhomirova 1991 this evidence strongly contradicts all hypotheses in which the wing originates from gills and gilllike structures a currently popular belief in the west the presence of stroke ability in the wing precursors is also disputable it suggests that a powerful muscle motor could be generated before the origin of flight because the generation of useful force by small wings requires high flapping frequency see also borin 1987 from theoretical considerations casey 1989 and experimental data feller and nachtigall 1989 energy expenditures and total power output are noticeably higher during hovering than horizontal flight in fact energy expenditure is normally a ushaped function of flight speed schmidtnielsen 1972 pennycuick 1975 rayner 1979b dudley 1992 only bumblebees are exceptions to this pattern owing to specific features of their flight kinematics dudley and ellington 1990a ellington et al 1990 the energetic value of takeoff is unknown but is apparently close to or exceeds that of hovering flight which suggests that the first flight mode to appear in evolution was straight flight because it is the easiest form of aerial locomotion later with the appearance of a more powerful wing motor the majority of insects acquired the capacity to overcome their own inertia and to take off from the ground in many groups of insects the difficulty of takeoff conditioned the evolution of auxiliary jump mechanisms which launched their bodies into flight certainly flapping wings can have a selective value in downward jumps participating in the control of fall direction birketsmith 1984 brodsky 1988 as in the german cockroach however this assumption still fails to answer the cause of protowing enlargement to an aerodynamically efficient size with respect to the problem of the wing morphologic precursor there are no serious reasons to deny the paranotal nature of the wings emelianov and falkovich 1983 this evolutionary scenario is especially attractive because flight could emerge before a complex muscle motor and differentiated pterothorax skeleton were formed logically the best historically and functionally corroborated concept of the origin of flight is the modification of the paranotal theory presented by rasnitsyn 1976a 1980 1981 fig 31 according to this hypothesis the ancestors of winged insects inhabited comparatively evolution of flight in the insect orders i 85 figure 31 hypothetical ancestors of winged insects from rasnitsyn 1976 tall vegetation in all probability these organisms could already behaviorally regulate body temperature their paranotallobes were theoretically adapted for the accumulation of solar heat douglas 1981 kingsolver and koehl1985 1989 1994 which favored the initial increase of these lateral thorax projections the ancestors of winged insects jumped from branch to branch while seeking food and avoiding attack by predators in this situation selection could favor further elongation of the paranotal lobes which gradually acquired the function of bearing planes plaiting or folding up of the primary wings supposedly originated simultaneously with their elongation if it had not long paranotallobes would have considerably handicapped insect movement among tree branches shwanvich 1946 among recent insects similar behavior is exhibited by the north 86 i form an nction of insect wings american grasshopper pterophylla camellifolia fabr gryllida pseudophyllinae alexander and brown 1963 however note that articulated paranotal lobes are present in some recent crustaceans and acari shwanvich 1946 zalessky 1949 acquisition of wingfolding ability provided prerequisites for the development of their motility insects acquired the capacity to change angle of attack and consequently to extend flight or to perform turns in a desired direction strokes could originate next first lowamplitude serving to augment starting vortices and then more energetic although the functional properties of bearing planes are aggravated after the appearance of strokes caple et al 1983 this disadvantage could be compensated for example by increased maneuverability or other capacities not necessarily concerned with wing apparatus and flight the origin of insect flight could also have been facilitated by a marked increase of atmospheric oxygen graham et al 1995 1997 32 initial wing kinematics rasnitsyn 1996 described the general procedure for tracing phylogenies as a set of presumptions according to one of them the least functionally efficient morphologic state of a given structure should be considered as the earliest and most primitive unless there is sufficiently strong evidence supporting a different viewpoint which of the malfunctional kinematic patterns corresponds to the beginning of flappingflight evolution the functionally twowinged flight of tiger beetles and some swallowtail butterflies with uncoupled fore and hindwings and the counterstrokes of dragonflies and damselflies are not aerodynamically advantageous see sec 35 but they are clearly secondary phenomena derived from wingbeats typical of these taxa according to the data presented in section 26 the first stroke cycle stage in anteromotoric functionally fourwinged inphase flappers is accompanied by the appearance of a separate vortex tube behind each wing fig 220 vortices of the fore and hindwing are located close to one another since the direction of their rotation is the same they reduce one anothers velocity and actually heat the surrounding air afterward the tubes coalesce and a ushaped bubble is formed however starting deceleration must negatively influence further circulation growth and vortex wake development decreasing the total aerodynamic force generated by the wings in this situation the fore and hindwings constitute competing generators evolution of flight in the lnsect orders i 87 of vortex flow therefore this is a maladaptive presumably primitive state this assumption is further supported by the fact that not one taxon characterized by anteromotoric inphase kinematics panorpida perlida myrmeleontida corydalida raphidiida embiida caddisflies rhyacophilidae primary moths micropterigidae and eriocraniidae includes species that possess flight capacities normally considered to be advanced that is with long duration high velocity ability to carry load in flight or pronounced maneuverability zorotypida which have very archaic flight apparatus morphology mesothorax independent of metathorax the former larger than the latter forewings larger and better developed than the hindwings a coupling mechanism is absent seem to constitute a group in which flight reduction is in progress although it is believed that these insects are capable of active dispersal and flight given their life in rotten wood no one has ever seen them flying choe 1992 personal communications of r c nelson and g t riegel remarkably the orders of typically anteromotoric fourwinged insects are among the least numerous and diversified orders of the class insecta borror et al 1992 the wingbeat kinematics of lacewings ellington 1984 scorpion flies fig 32a and stoneflies fig 32b are quite similar these insects are characterized by comparatively low from 15 to 50 hz stroke frequency fig 33 and yfng afig 34 and by medium coupleaseect r fig 35 during the stroke cycle the wings of these insects move in a plane almost perpendicular to the longitudinal body axis the forewings are not coupled with the hindwings and perform independent strokes at the end of each stroke cycle the wings meet above the body in a movement termed weisfogh 1973 owing to the clap the forewings are motionless at the very beginning of the stroke tightly adjoining each other by their dorsal surfaces after the stroke begins the forewings pronate and open in a booklike manner grodnitsky and morozov 1994 this is the fling mechanism as initially described by weisfogh 1973 wing translation occurs only after fling finishes strokes of the fore and hindwing pairs are synchronized in a specific manner the forewings constantly move ahead of the hindwings but display a smaller amplitude hence when deceleration and supination of the forewings begin in the lower part of the trajectory the hindwings leave them behind performing a more

strategies were used during the course of insect flight evolution the first anteromotoric strategy can be realized by means of two methods the first consists in augmenting the forewing strokes weakening the hindwing strokes andor diminishing the size of the hindwings fig 36b fossil scorpion flies whose hindwings were considerably decreased typify this particular flight system rohdendorf and rasnitsyn 1980 shcherbakov et al 1995 scorpion flies with shortened hindwings are suggested to have f ld coupling of fore and hind wings figure 36 evolutionary adaptive changes of wing kinematics in

the upper side of the leading edge of the wings arrows show the direction of the wings movement dotted line indicates rotational flow vortices evolution of flight in the insect orders i 93 given rise to the clade of dipterous insects fig 36c with the transformation of the hindwings into halteres this viewpoint is supported by the fact that one of the two patterns of phase relationships between the wings and halteres found in muscida is typical for the functionally fourwinged inphase anteromotoric flappers see sec 39 indicating that the ancestors of dipterous flies did not have linked fore and hindwings the second method to remove the malfunctional interaction between fore and hind starting vortex tubes consists in the coupling of fore and hindwings into a single flapping surface each surface generates one tube sec 24 hence the circulation and vortex ring develop without starting deceleration fig 36d in this case the magnitude of bound vortex intensity of vortex ring rotation and its contribution to the generation of useful forces are evidently increased for the entire stroke period the evolution of functional twowingedness in many taxa is associated with the decrease in relative hindwing size in some cases the hindwings are completely lost resulting in the origin of morphologic twowingedness fig 36c the second strategy results through transfer of the function of the primary vorticity generator from the fore to the hindwings it is found in functionally fourwinged inphase posteromotoric insects their stroke cycle begins with opening of the hindwings leading to earlier formation of the hind starting tubes since any vortex is a zone of reduced pressure the hind starting bubbles induce a flow that prevents the development of vortices behtd the forewings ilig36e under a definite intensity of hindwing strokes owing to created rarefaction formation of vortices after the forewings becomes impossible posteromotoric inphase fourwinlinematics is more effective than anteromotoric the weightspecific lilsfold after the phase shift decreases to zero locusts use this strategy to regulate flight power output worlmann and zatragk lj93 the reduced strokes of forewings reduce their thrust and lift relative to the hindwings whereas drag experienced by the forewings remains roughly the same therefore the aerodynamic effectiveness of flight can be improved through complete transfer of the locomotor function to the hindwings this path of flight evolution like the two previously described anteromotoric specializations becomes complete with the appearance of morphologically twowinged forms fig 36c thus the major patterns of the wmgs operation and the corresponding patterns of vortex formation based on the results of comparative flight aero 94 i form

between the fore and hindwings present typical examples of morphofunctional change under longterm stabilizing selection resulting in decreased energy waste which is the major consequence of stabilizing selection after schmalhausen 1949 1969 it is also quite remarkable that only three two anteromotoric and a posteromotoric conceivable opportunities to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of the most primitive anteromotoric functionally fourwinged flying systems exist and that all three have been realized through the evolution of insect flight the suggested explanation does not totally exhaust the problem because historical transformations of wingbeat kinematics are not confined to the adaptations that result in more mechanically effective aerial propelling agents the classification of kinematic patterns fig 18 also includes less efficient varieties inadaptive from the perspective of flight energy expenditures these cases characteristic of some orders will be considered in the next six sections of this chapter following rasnitsyns phylogeny of insects rohdendorf and rasnitsyn 1980 rasnial1997 34 grylloid insects most insects included in the infraclass gryllones are functionally fourwinged and posteromotoric see chap 1 however they also include anteromqoric jrms namely stoneflies anteromotorism probably characterizes j_las well judging from their larger forewings and mesothorax as well as from their general similarity to insects in the order perlida martynov 1938 which suggests that the initial wingbeat kinematics of grylloid insects was the anteromotoric functionally fourwinged the possession in stoneflies of features primitive for gryllones and common to rock crawlers is consistent with the hypothesis that anteromotorism was typical also of this order normally placed at the root of grylloid insect phylogeny rohdendorf and rasnitsyn 1980 thus the entire natural group perlida grylloblattida embiida is characterized by the initial kinematics for flying insects the origin of gryllones is connected with the transition to a hidden mode of life rohdendorf and rasnitsyn 1980 this suggests that early grylloids were not exposed to environmental stimuli for flight improvement and is further supported by the comparatively elusive flight of many contemporary grylloid insects only some shorthorned grasshoppers gryllida acrididae evolution of flight in the insect orders i 95 can migrate for long distances and threefourths of the species in grylloid orders are completely flightless dudley 1999 despite their posteromotoric kinematics the flight of orthopteroids can hardly be called advanced one of the indicators of primitiveness can be a relatively staple knelllilts and hence srn_ctlltni311qverability the turn of a flying specimen is

dr9qntl1gilateral sigg as will be shown advanced insect fliers are capable of considerably sharper maneuvers the long independent evolution of grylloid insects resulted in peculiarities of the construction and operation of their wing apparatus thus grylloids possess a specific plaiting of wings that differs greatly from that of other insects martynov 1924b 1938 they are also unique in their use of the liftcontroli21 gettrulandjyjlson 1964 although this reaction is not always observed in experimental and natural conditions zamacklruiwortmat1989 it has never been found in other insects eg see figs 210 and 211 an exception is given only by dipterous flies sec 39 the weak flight of grylloid insects may result from the majority of species primarily the gryllida the largest order among gryllones feeding on the green parts of plants food that is low in calories and highly toxic the digestion of this material requires a bulky gut which contributes significantly to the total mass of grylloid specimens hence wing loading increases which requires a higher stroke frequency and enhanced energy consumption although grylloid insects lack the asynchronous flight musculature necessary for flight at high wingbeat frequencies cullen 1974 olldkyl92lb relatively heavy digestive systems explain the general rarity of leafeating forms among flying animals dudley and vermeij 1992 1994 this increased mass 96 i form and h wn of insect wings probably also induced the development of strong jumping hindlimbs in many grylloid insects a starting jump launches the specimen into flight these insects are unable to take off without the help of their feet because takeoff requires kinematics more powerful than in straight flight sec 31 35 damselflies and dragonflies the libellulida possess the most diversified kinematics among all the pterygota they most typically display antiphase strokes observed in comparatively small species in all maneuvers and in larger specimens primarily in hovering this is true for both the zygopteran and anisopteran suborders occasionally they perform flight with only hindwing strokes while the forewings are immovably stretched out ruppel 1989 sometimes the opposite occurs and only the forewings operate zalessky 1955 although it is impossible to definitely state the type of kinematics exhibited by ancestors of the libellulida anteromotoric functional fourwingedness seems an appropriate candidate and has been found in some species of damselflies ruppell1989 characteristically when dragonflies needtomrat enhancelift in natural

the side of the nction while the stroke plane of the bjndwings is inclined to the op_osite side thus during a right turn the forewings generate force that turns the head rightward while the hindwing pair simultaneously turns the abdomen leftward as a result within a single stroke or less the dragonfly rotates_around the vertical axis that passes through the border betwn the mesax alexyldir n e 1986 however note that turns of this type are only possible when the centelof mass is located betwn the hingeingsa feature not typical of other insects having acquired the ability to independently operate each wing dragonflies began to waste more energy but became much more maneuverable this kinematics allows them to perform the most diverse maneuvers to fly sideways and even in reverse direction zalessky 1955 ryazanova 1966 riippell 1989 thus higher energy waste is compensated by increased hunting effectiveness moreover energy expenditure of the wings as propelling agents is diminished with an increased aspect ratio because a greater flapping surface area decreases the amount of energy necessary for flapping flight weisfogh 1964 heinrich 1974 pennycuick 1975 casey et al 1985 thus dragonflies having separated early from the root of scarabaeiformes cimiciformes clade underwent a fundamentally distinct evolution of flight function and acquired two major wing apparatus operating modes a more po erful in hase osteromotoric modith high aerodynamic efficiency and a lescal but more rna ntiphase de selection of cthis evolutionary route was channeled by a predatory mode of life in open air spaces finally the kinematic lability of dragonflies is described by a set of several highly advanced features and appears as an extreme and narrow 98 i form and tion of insect wings specialization on the base of plesiomorphic noncoupled wings stabilization of primitive traits is a fairly regular phenomenon in organisms that separated early from the common evolutionary stem of their taxon in general the libellulida provide a curious case that seems to contradict the concept of symmorphosis because they possess a flight system apparently constructed in excess of what is normally needed given their mode of life this can be seen from the data on stroke amplitude in different flight situations increase of amplitude is the most common way to enhance the aerodynamic forces generated by insects see sec 210 meanwhile damselflies and dragonflies fly at low stroke amplitudes averaging 115 for zygoptera and 83 for anisoptera riippell 1989 the highest value of 150 was recorded in a male leucorrhinia rubicunda libellulidae that was taking off vertically carrying a female incopula riippell1989 low stroke amplitude gives an impression that the wing apparatus of dragonflies is capable of much higher force output than normally required this outstanding ability permits the libellulida to use their wings in counterstroke kinematics that is evidently ineffective aerodynamically but provides the insects with more efficient hunting behavior and even during counterstrokes the amplitude does not exceed 130 riippell1989 36 hymenopterans and rhynchote insects the association of these two orders in one section may seem unusual since rhynchote insects are unrelated to hymenopterans and do not exhibit complete metamorphosis however a series of substantial analogies can be traced in the functional and morphologic organization of vespida and cimicida wing apparatus both orders are functionally twowinged likewise this state is initial because forms with uncoupled wings are unknown even in the fossil condition rasnitsyn 1980 rohdendorf and rasnitsyn 1980 the shape of the flapping surface is also similar its aspect ratio varies between 18 and 40 danforth 1989 in hymenoptera and between 19 and 39 in heteroptera grodnitsky 1996 fig 35 the stroke frequency is quite high considerably exceeding 60 hz in both orders fig 33 it is only low in huge belostomatid bugs total mass 234 g body length 105 mm at 2125hz barber and pringle 1965 but this is evidently an extraordinary case in rhynchote insects the frequency approaches 145 strokes per second betts 1986c specialized foraging hymenopterans evolution of flight in the inseet orders i 99 which frequently transport considerable additional mass during flight display stroke frequencies of 250280 hz magnan 1934 unwin and corbet 1984 a maximal frequency of 350370 hz has been observed in the microscopic wasp encarsia weisfogh 1973 the stroke plane is inclined at an angle of 3060 to the body in all species investigated except for the jumping plant lice amblyrrhina maculata low psyllidae the primary part of the flapping surface is elastic in addition the predominant type of wing kinematics in the upper part of the stroke cycle is near cle12dpeel the wings touch each other by the trailing edges only slightly in the beginning of the stroke clap has only been observed in tethered allantus sp tenthredinidae grodnitsky and morozov 1994 the forewings of the majority of heteropteran and hymenopteran species undergo ventral flexion of their distal parts at the end of the downstroke the wings of urocerus gigas l flex slightly but distinctly near the midspan fig 37a throughout the second halfcycle the flapping surface is generally concave along several furrows and the line of the wingsfig 37a at the same time in rhynchote insects the forewing anal field overlaps the costal margin of the hindwing so that the forewing remigioanal furrow combines_with the costal vein of the hindwing as a result this furrow and the line of the wings coupling work as a single deformation line in several cases the loss of independence by the hindwings leads to a decrease in their size and sometimes to their complete reduction resulting in a morphologically twowinged condition this state is found in mymar mymaridae and mymarommatidae from vespida and coccoidea among cimicida however note that these are exceptional instances absence of the morphologically twowinged condition in flying bugs is presumably caused by the defensive function of their thick cuticle and elytra loss of hindwings requires an increase in the stroke frequency of the forewings which is difficult to achieve with massive elytra this explains the often considerable dwarfing of the hindwing pair which nonetheless rarely disappear completely popov 1971 in many higher hymenopterans hindwing reduction is constrained by their need to take care of progeny along with the necessity to transport paralyzed prey nectar and pollen to provision nests hence the flight of higher hymenopterans evolved in a direction to support loadlifting capacjty these flyers can carry more than twice their own weight fabr 1914 hindwing reduction increases the loading of the forewings and correspondingly diminishes takeoff ability when carrying additional mass note that social a b evolution of flight in the inslct orders i 101 hymenopterans are characterized by the highest loading found in insects up to 3035 njm 2 and greater even with four welldeveloped wings magnan 1934 marden 1987 dudley and ellington 1990b the rarity of morphologically twowinged forms among other higher hymenoptera suborder vespina in general still remains unexplained 37 beetles the majority of beetle species are posteromotoric functionally fourwinged insects fig 38 this condition is associated with the transformation of the forewings into elytra resulting in transfer of the main propulsive function to the hindwings intermediate forms that connect the beetles with more generalized groups of scarabaeiformes and that indicate the process of formation of coleopteroid appearance are unknown among both recent and fossil forms rohdendorf and rasnitsyn 1980 therefore the question of whether posteromotoric flight is primitive for this order remains unanswered and is closely linked to the problem of taxonomy of the ancestors of scarabaeida the stroke frequency of coleopterans is higher than in generalized insects with complete metamorphosis but noticeably lower than in insects with frequent flaps in beetles it constitutes from 30 to 40 hz fig 33 magnan 1934 weisfogh 1973 to 100130 hz fig 33 baker 1965 weisfogh 1973 grodnitsky and morozov 1994 the stroke plane of many species is vertical but can be strongly inclined eg in cetonia grodnitsky and morozov 1994 wing loading is well above medium insect value fig 34 owing to the heavy exoskeleton and stroke amplitude is comparatively high 150180 presumably for the same reason the elytra of beetles provide a typical example of conflict between two functions namely flapping flight and protection of the wings and body in accordance the kinematics of elytra is strongly modified because they are considerably more massive than regular insect wings schneider 1975 described four flight types in beetles based on differences in the motion of the elytra in the majority of species the elytra perform strokes of small no more than 3040 amplitude and the wings and elytra oscillate almost synchronously fig 38bd in cicindela they are fully facing page figure 37 deformation

necrophorus acts in a similar manner but was separated by schneider into a distinct flight type a flight mode not considered by schneider also exists the middle asian metallic woodboring beetles acmaeodera and acmaeoderella buprestidae possess fused elytra before takeoff they open the elytra like a car hood and in flight hold them raised almost perpendicular to the body ivanov v d grodnitsky d l unpublished data these five types of coleopteran flight demonstrate different ways to resolve the contradiction between functions and probably do not exhaust the entire diversity of flight in this very peculiar group the major aerodynamic force necessary for flight in beetles is created by the hindwings schneider and hermes 1976 the anal fields of the wings are elastic and in the upper part of their trajectory demonstrate flexible fling or peelsee ellington 1984 pause in motion clap has been observed in several species in others the wings do not stop between sequential strokes grodnitsky and morozov 1994 in cetonia the left and right wings do not touch each other either over or under the body deformation of the wings in beetles is confined to a smooth convexity during pronation formation of a gutter in the posteroproximal zone during downstroke smooth concavity and occasionally bending along the remigioanal furrow during supination and upstroke bending along the concave secondary anal furrow has been observed only in cetonia grodnitsky and morozov 1994 in all cases only the anojugal part of the wing is cambered thrmi_gium remainsflat or xhibits a slight gradual profile throughout the entire stroke cycle the absence of sharp deformation in this zone is quite surg since the remgium of beetles containsseveral secondary longitudinal and transversal furrows that serve for wing plaiting at ist see sec 45 the prese furrqwsnot only fails to generate apomorphic flight deformations of the wings but instead seems to have an oppqsite effect imparting to the remigium a stiffness rall uncharadetistic c this wing region the rarity of morphologically twowinged beetles reflects the possession of a heavy external skeleton and consequently the beetles need to geoerate relatively high lift elctra are used for this pwpose but their effectiveness is reduced because of the inabi1ity to create thoot for this reason most beetles fly slowly in comparison with other insects the role of the elytra as generators of pure lift is illustrated by the flight characteristics of the flower beetle cetonia owing to morphologic twowingedness its wings experience extremely high 413 nm 2 loading magnan 1934 hence this beetle must 104 i form an nction of insect wings operate its wings at relatively high in comparison with other coleopterans stroke frequency 100 hz weisfogh 1973 the kinematic parameters of beetles therefore provide evidence for enhanced flight power output likewise their wings work in a regime close to the functional limit since coleopterans have the least additional loadlifting capacity among all the insects mardenj982 38 caddisflies moths and butterflies the orders phryganeida and papilionida are related and form the monophyletic group amphiesmenoptera of a rank intermediate between order and superorder caddisflies and moths possess many similar features of wing morphology and function at the same time the functional and morphologic diversity of modifications of the wing apparatus is noticeably higher in the amphiesmenoptera than within any large scarabaeona order the most primitive recent amphiesmenoptera are anteromotoric functionally fourwinged forms their flight kinematics does not differ substantially from that of myrmeleontida and panorpida which include caddisflies rhyacophilidae ivanov 1985a primary moths micropterigidae and eriocraniidae and ghost moths hepialidae grodnitsky and kozlov 1991 they differ from neuropterans and scorpion flies primarily because at the end of downstroke the wings of many species undergo ventral flexiqlqlmtilljart as a rule the distal third region of the wing that bends down demonstrates peculiar trapezialike deformation fig 39 all amphiesmenoptera except the clearwing moth aegeria have a vertical stroke plane the fore and hindwings of caddisflies and moths operate in flight as an entire lifting surface even when special coupling mechanisms are absent as for example in butterflies the trajectories of both wings are therefore almost identical although the amplitude of the hind pair oscillations is slightly increased the construction of coupling mechanisms displays considerable morphologic diversity in different groups ivanov 1989 borror et al 1992 indicating the independence of their origins and the opportunity of an organism to obtain an identical functional result through different morphologic adaptations the stroke frequency of caddisflies is quite uniform and constitutes from 16 to 50 hz fig 33 in lepidopterans the wingbeat frequency is considerably

diurnal forms vielmetter 1958 clench 1966 watt 1968 in large lepidopterans that fly well the specific thermoregulatory strategy defined two major evolutionary ways of wing transformation broadening of the wings followed by reduction of their flight stroke frequency and narrowing of the flapping surface under simultaneous increase of frequency fig 310 the endothermic temperature regulation observed in representatives of the superfamilies sphingoidea noctuoidea and notodontoidea requires high stroke frequency thus the progressive evolution of flight function indicated by an increase in flight range rapidity and maneuverability in endothermic moths was achieved in parallel with narrowing of the wing surface at a relatively high 6085 hz stroke frequency improvement of flight characteristics in diurnal ectothermic butterflies hesperioidea papilionoidea was accompanied by widening of both wing pairs because they play the role of heat lqn wasserthal 1975 broadening of the wing surface accomplishes more effective ectothermic heating but at the same time limits stroke frequency which in large pieridae and papilionidae decreases to 48 hz the use qflirldtcli9tu c 9l1if olhe allowed butterflies to reduce the energy consumption of the wing apparatus as a locomotor system on the other hand the adaptive value of endothermic temperature regulation is also evident the development of a powerful thoracic musculature capable of prolonged work at high contractile frequency enhanced the loadlifting capacity of the wing apparatus of moths permitting increased total body mass enhanced fecundity and storage of fat and other reserve compounds broadwinged forms may also be found among crepuscular and nocturnal lepidopterans these include giant silkworm moths many inchworm moths and related families giant silkworm moths saturniidae are endothermic lepidopterans that engage in preflight warmup hanegan and heath 1970a 1970b with temperature indices extremely similar to analogous

dorsett 1962 weisfogh 1964 the heat produced during the preflight warmup is retained through the insulation provided by a dense scale covering in addition some species eg aglia tau l have become secondarily diurnal inchworm moths geometridae are apparently neither endo nor ectothermic insects because the temperature of the thoracic muscles of operophtera bruceata hulst and alsophila pometaria harris flying in an air temperature of 3c equals 0 heinrich and mommsen 1985 the biochemical and tissue adaptations that permit cold muscles to work are comprehensively discussed by he3 some amphiesmenopteran groups are characterized by feathgrlikejdgs with gjqimargidllfringqfales fig 310b and by wings split into two or three featherlike lobes fig 310g with a hairy fringe overlapping the gaps between the lobes contrary to the early assumption made by rohdendorf 1949 this construction is not associated with flight peculiarities wingbeat kinematics in these groups is not significantly different from that of caddisflies and lepidopterans with whole wings norberg 1972c ellington 1984 kozlov et al 1986 in fact a hick bouutyillydqlaliqytir_t_opass througlttheftinge so featherwinged and splitwinged moths fly in the same manner as other papilionida the formation of featherlike wings is a reaction to the decrease in the absolute size of specimens in tiny species the fringe is relatively stronger than in large insects in addition it is lighter and thus of greater adaptive value than a solid wing a split flapping plane may be associated with wing plaiting wasserthal1974 because splits along furrows prevent the appearance of objectional deformations of the wing membrane when the wings are being folded at rest indeed more or less deep cuts often mark the place of a furrow influx into the wing edge however manyplumed moths alucitidae do not fold up their wings at plaiting so this is an equivocal explanation development of thermoregulatory ability in lepidopterans is closely related to the most distinct morphologic feature of the order namely the presence of a covering of the flattened hairs called scales the covering is a good heat insulator clench 1966 heinrich 1970 heinrich and bartholomew 1971 and its structure reflects the peculiarities of moth thermoregulatory physiology see sec 483 furthermore the covering contributes considerable evolution of flight in the insect orders i 109 mass to the wings for example in heliconiidae butterflies scales constitute up to onethird of the total wing mass dudley 1999 whereas in noctuid lasiocampid and other large moths the covering can be much heavier this additional mass constrains the increase in stroke frequency in papilionida the potential danger of overheating from intense muscle contractions provides another source of constraint on wingbeat frequency consequently no lepidopterans have a wingbeat frequency above 7090 hz fig 33 magnan 1934 weisfogh 1973 bartholomew and casey 1978 and flappers with the higeat freq11encies g clearwing moths have lost scales on their vings the prohibition of high stroke frequency agrees well with the a of asynchronous thoracic musculature in tdoptenms dudley 1991b and the exceptional rarity of morphologically twowinged species among moths the specific character of the flight performance of papilionida is defined by the numerous forms that have extremely low frequency aspect ratio and wing loading figs 3335 an important peculiarity of lepidopteran kinematics is that the wings constl and s oo eir geometric angle of attack throughout the stroke cycle the stroke cycle does not contain periods when this angle is constant grodnitsky and morozov 1994 kinematics and deformation of the wings in the upper part of their trajectory can be different amphiesmenopterans principally exhibit the flexible modhicatioa of ling termed peel ellington 1984 the wings open gradually during peel like two sheets of thin paper in addition many of the studied specimens had no period in their wingbeat cycle when the left and right wings completely adjoined each other over the body thus the wings often fail to pause in the upper part of the trajectory and their motion is not interrupted between the two consecutive strokes this motion was named neqr clapandpeel ellington 1984 wing deformation at the end of the downstroke and during supination is even more diverse grodnitsky and morozov 1994 in many species typical tip ventral flexion is observed accompanied by a trap_ezialike deformation fig 39 persisting within the majn part of upstroke in addition smooth wing flexion can take place often accompanied by downward bending ofthe ent characteristically sharp flexion of the distal third is primarily seen in generalized caddisflies and butterflies with stroke frequency medium for the group 2040 hz this type of deformation was not observed in specialized lepidopterans both narrow and broadwinged their wings bend

deformation of an amphiesmenopteran wing along the secondary concave furrows that serve for plaiting of the wings in the rest position has never been observed surprisingly the presence of completely developed remigial and remigioanal furrows in many specimens does not produce additional flexion of the wings throughout the entire second halfcycle grodnitsky and morozov 1994 39 dipterous flies the

communication but the available information does not provide an answer 310 functional assessment of some elements of wing kinematics and deformation having observed the diversity of wingbeat kinematics found in different lines of insect phylogeny it is interesting to assess peculiarities of wing kinematics and deformation from the viewpoint of the aerodynamic phenomena that accompany a generalized wingbeat cycle which were summarized in sections 27 and 28 fling undoubtedly generates useful force its effectiveness is a subtle function of the absolute size of an insect although it can slightly increase with diminution of the flier lighthill1978 however its contribution to the total balance of forces in mediumsized and large insects is probably not great the impact of fling could be quite high if the airflow separated from the wing leading edge and formed a corresponding vortex structure but visualization 114 i form and 1 ion of insect wings experiments on flow around living

caused by the collaborative action of morphogenetic and selective forces dogel 1954 1981 suggested the most general path for origination of novel constructions in his concept of polymerization and oligomerization in evolution primordial elements from which the novelty is then assembled initially appear as numerous serial homologues that is as typical manifestations of ontogenetic regularities next natural selection enhances some of them and suppresses others kokshaysky 1974 1980 called this process concentration of a function thus a new organ appears in the part of the organisms body where it is needed in other words morphogenesis offers numerous similar minor traits that are then differentiated by natural selection and transformed into general adaptations initially the terrestrial hexapod ancestors of winged insects had serial evolution of flight in the lnsect orders i 117 lateral cuticular thickenings on each segment nota intensive locomotion is always adaptive in the general sense enabling prey or mate capture and escape from predators hence the early ability to accumulate solar radiation to intensify muscle contraction is predictable to accumulate heat that comes from above any widening of the nota is advantageous but especially of those located close to the locomotor muscles notal cuticular thickenings therefore were enlarged and became what we call paranota most pronounced on the thoracic segments at this stage paranota of smaller size were situated on the abdominal segments they were potentially useful in increasing the rate of digestion and maturation of reproductive products through heat accumulation the thoracic paranota primarily used for regulation of body temperature next accepted the ability for gliding then for flight and finally became wings in parallel insects developed bulky thoracic muscles capable of intensive contractions and inevitable heat generation the internal heat was further used to warm the rest of the body thus abdominal paranota became unnecessary and in most species were strongly reduced the first winged insects had four wings that flapped synchronously with a small phase shift with the forewings leading the hindwings this kinematic condition was characterized by starting vortex generation independently by each wing in the beginning of each stroke cycle the vortices interfered with one another preventing rapid growth of aerodynamic force the primary functional result insects achieved during early flight evolution was removal of this interference either by reducing one of the two wing pairs or by uniting the fore and hindwings into two couples so that only one starting vortex was generated per stroke the principal types of strokes originated as a result an interesting and important correlation can be traced between the constructions of insect flying and feeding systems insects with the most primitive anteromotoric functionally fourwinged flight scorpion flies lacewings primitive moths stoneflies snakeflies and alderflies have mouthparts of the primitive mandibulate ype all the insect groups specialized on posteromotoric flight dragonflies grasshoppers crickets mantids cockroaches earwigs and beetles retain the manibulate mouthparts at the same time all advanced anteromotoric flyers dipterous flies moths butterflies wasps bees and bugs possess mouthparts of the hautellate type the only exception are mayflies which are anteromotoric insects without a haustellum however mayflies also po not have mandibulate mouthparts because their imago do not feed the described correlation probably has an explanation in functional and 118 i form ana ction of insect wings ecologic terms the most usual reason for the origin of posteromotorism is the participation of the forewings in the defensive function as the forewings become thicker stiffer and therefore heavier the flapping flight function becomes a responsibility of the hindwings the defensive properties of the forewings are thought to correlate with the hidden life mode of imago dwelling in the litter of prehistoric forests such an ecology is assumed for primitive scarabaeida and gryllones which supposedly lived inside substrate rohdendorf and rasnitsyn 1980 in all likelihood they were carnivorous and detritophagous insects this mode of life agrees well with the mandibulate mouthparts by contrast the ancestors of anteromotoric insects probably inhabited tall vegetation the open environment stimulated further evolution of active flight thus functional and morphologic twowingedness appeared moreover the origination of different kinds of haustellum was stimulated by the availability of unoccupied vast food sources such as the liquid contents of plant stems and generative organs and later animal blood the presented explanation is of course very preliminary the further evolutionary improvement of flight function included an increase in efficiency power output or energy effectiveness maneuverability and control mechanisms of flight these parameters could change quite independently of one another comparison of the data on wing motion and vortex dynamics allows an explanation of the main diversity of kinematic phenomena in terms of adaptation adaptive significance can be ascribed to aspects of stroke asymmetry type of phase relationships between foreand hindwings fling and swingingedge mechanisms simultaneously different flight functional peculiarities obtain explanation for separate taxa for example typical frequency and amplitude of strokes flight speed and capability or incapability to perform specific maneuvers and to take off from the ground also some morphologic features become understandable namely the total number of wings relative size of fore and hindwing pairs width of the flapping surface in papilionida and wing hinges and such apomorphic ordinal traits as coupling adaptations and the alula in the muscida on the other hand few constructional features of the wings can be interpreted in this manner the problem of evolutionary correlation between structure and function is much more complex it is considered in detail using examples of endopterygote insect wing morphology in chapter 4 4 problems of endopterygote insect wing functional morphology the title of this chapter reflects the complexity inherent in any explanation of the morphology of organisms there are few cases in which the cause of the evolutionary formation of specific morphologic features of insect wings is clear several such examples were given in chapter 3 specifically the features that describe the common principles of wing apparatus construction the total number and relative size of the wings meanwhile published literature contains various opinions on the functions of peculiar structures expressed in the form of hypotheses direct verification of these assumptions requires special equipment and is often in principle unrealizable nevertheless verification is possible to some extent through the comparative analysis of the wing morphology of different groups of insects demonstrating homoplasies that is features of secondary similarity that have independently originated on different evolutionary pathways classification of secondary similarities presented in the appendix under basic definitions see tab a1 is based on the reasons causing the origination of homoplasies however concrete evolutionary basis for the origin of secondary similarity in different organisms is often obscure these characters are therefore usually classified not by the reason but rather by the degree of relatedness of the organisms if the compared species are nonrelated eg belong to different orders the similarity is ascribed to natural selection which causes evolution of similar functions resulting in the origin of convergent analogous structures darwin 1872 plate 1928 schmalhausen 1969 bliakher 1976 mednikov 1980 simpson 1980 vorobjova 1980 menner and makridin 1988 functional identity is traditionally considered an adequate explanation for identity of form hence we can confirm or reject a functional interpretation of a given structure by assessing the reliability of a similar functional 120 i form and 1 ion of insect wings interpretation of the same structure in an unrelated taxon this method of indirect assay is used in the discussion of the material presented in this chapter the terminology for veins and furrows will initially be introduced then the particular wing morphologies of all endopterygote insect main orders will be discussed and assessed from the perspective of insect wing comparative functional morphology after considering all currently available functional interpretations of given structural features the appraisal will not be restricted to any particular group of insects a broader approach will prevent the confusing speculations often made when the morphology of only a single taxon is considered insects with complete metamorphosis account for more than 655000 known species borror et al 1992 a complete overview of wing construction of this entire group is consequently impossible and the focus of research must be limited in this respect venation was studied in greatest detail in caddisflies moths and butterflies since these insects give long series of forms intermediate between primitive and advanced unlike other large orders of scarabaeiformes that first appeared in fossil history in their typical form within the discussion presented subsequently the principal attention will be paid to furrows rather than veins furrow topography was studied more thoroughly in the muscida vespida phryganeida and papilionida grodnitsky 199la 1991b grodnitsky and morozov 1994 the remaining large holometabolan order the beetles will be represented by only a dozen species owing to the current situation regarding beetle wing comparative morphology two large articles have recently been published kukalovapeck and lawrence 1993 zherikhin and gratshev 1995 both articles are extremely rich in original material however they also contain a vast number of mutual contradictions so that a special examination seems to be necessary for appropriate comprehension the more so because the difference in opinions expressed on beetle wing morphology is not closely related to the context of this book i used data on comparative morphology as no more than a tool to assess functional hypotheses and an intensive analysis of structural diversity in all the subtaxa of scarabaeiformes was not initially planned the wing covering of lepidopterans is considered an interesting and poorly studied example of a peculiar wing part problems of endopterygote insect wing functional mor jgy i 121 41 topology of veins and furrows each vein as a rule has a characteristic location relative to the wing membrane in the basal part of the wing thus all the veins are divided into upper radius generally designated as r radial sector rs lower subcosta sc media m cubitus posterior cup and neutral the remainder rohdendorf 1949 emelianov 1977 an exception is presented by the anterior branch of the cubitus cua of caddisflies which occupies an upper location on the forewings and a lower on the hindwings this state of the cua is observed in many taxonomically nonrelated insects as well as in representatives of the order paoliida thought to be the most probable ancestor of all scarabaeiformes rasnitsyn 1980 in all likelihood the upper location of the anterocubital vein on the forewing and lower on the hindwing is primitive for winged insects at a distance from the axillary sclerites the type of vein convexity changes differently in different species hence it is impossible to trace a regularity in their arrangement as was observed by zalessky 1943 for example in chaetopteryx villosa f phryganeida limnephilidae all the veins of the distal wing part are raised above the membrane whereas in narosoideus flavidorsalis stgr papilionida limacodidae they are depressed instead grodnitsky 1991a individual veins can be strengthened in various ways wing strength is primarily increased through the formation of a secondary relief of the wing membrane in dipterous flies beetles and hymenopterans this can be achieved by microscopic corrugation along the wing margin bocharovamessner 1979a figs 172 173 180 secondary gutters can be large and are usually located along the main lclns in some cases they become veinlike because of secondary sclerotization and thickening of the membrane the best example is given by the false vein vena spuria of flower flies syrphidae a similar formation is found in caddisfliesa characteristic cuticular thickening that goes along the vein for its entire length this

version most widely used at present is that developed by comstock and needham 1898 1899 coj91b and modified by snodgrass 1935 hamiltons 1972a 1972b nomenclature sometimes used for entomologic education and incorporated in certain textbooks ross et al 1982 received deserved criticism from emelianov 1977 and cannot be accepted the proposals of hamilton are fundamentally unsupported by argumentation his system in general suggests a noncritical hybridization of the nomenclatures of forbes 1943 and snodgrass 1935 hereinafter the designations of comstock needham and snodgrass are used the wings of primitive caddisflies and moths bear eight primary longitudinal veins costa c sc r with branching rs m with two branches media anterior ma and media posterior mp cu with cua and cup postcubitus pcu and two anal veins 1a and 2a fig 45 hamilton postulated independence of the rs and cup giving them the status of primary veins this viewpoint contradicts data on vein paleontology martynova 1960 and comparative morphology including tracheation of the veins emelianov 1977 the cubital branches are indeed quite different in appearance the cua is generally twobranched well developed and sclerotized together with the sc and r it constitutes the main body of the remigium in cases in which the cua is weakened it is mechanically enhanced by means of precubital thickening in contrast to the cua the posterocubital vein is always considerably weakened and thin and cortairs littlemelanin_pigment the concave furrow passes along its entire length and separates the remigium from the clavus consequently the anterior and posterior cubital veins are functionally different cua reinforces the wing whereas cup is initially associated with the longitudinal furrow cannot etlhance wing rigidity and is reduced in the majority of lepidopterans with advanced venation in many caddisflies ivanov 1985b 1987a 1987b and in some primitive moths hepialidae sharplin 1963a 1963b the functional difference of the cua and cup results in their departing independently from the axillary sclerites instead of merging basally if this were their primary relationship hamiltons 1972a viewpoint could be accepted following forbes 1943 he designated the cup as an independent plical vein however cua and cup are fused proximally in the supposed ancestors of caddisflies from paoliida

between the cua and cup the postcubital and anal veins are situated behind the cu the independence of the pcu in relation to 1a and 2a is well substantiated and unquestionable in the generalized state this vein always comes from the third axillary sclerite 3ax irrespective of the anal veins emelianov 1977 ivanov 1994 in this instance hamiltons proposal could be accepted and the pcu could be termed the empusal vein since the pcu has no relation to the cu located in another functional zone of the wing clavus and being related to another part of axillary appartus namely 3ax but not with medial

equal to two in the majority of cases neither the pcu nor 1a or 2a bifurcate in the nomenclature proposed by emelianov see also brodsky 1987 1988 furrows are named according to the veins that pass parallel in front of them a basic disadvantage of this system of designations is that the same furrow can be situated differently relative to a given vein a furrow can cross an accompanying vein and then travel either behind or in front of it fig 47ac a furrow can be expressed in some species as a band of light softmembrane passing at i5qtksides qfa vein fig 47a b d furthermore the veins that are associated with furrows are often reduced for example in lepidopterans the partial or complete reduction of m and cup is quite common fig 48 in these cases the direct use of the emelianov nomenclature principle leads to situations in which the same furrow acquires different names the medial furrow becomes the furrow of rs whereas the cup becomes an anterocubital furrow wootton 1979 suggests inadequate terms for example it is unclear what distinguishes his line and his furrow furthermore he classifies furrows according to their functions differentiating flexion lines and fold lines such a functional approach to classifying morphologic structures is inappropriate from my viewpoint because flexion lines too often secondarily participate in wing folding as will be shown later consequently i will use the nomenclature of martynov 1924 in which a furrow is designated according to the wing zone within which it is located or according to the zones that are demarcated by the furrow in martynovs nomenclature the three primary furrows are termed remigial plica remigialis remigioanal p remigioanalis concave and anajugal p anojugalis convex fig 47 the c9ncave furrows ar_fjjj1for

moths eg alphus sylvinus l hepialidae large ghost moths also have distinct anal and jugal angles although their wings are secondarily widened the planform of the wings of primitive moths suggested as symplesiomorphic for the order kozlov 1987 1988 should be considered to be a specialization originating with the decrease in body size because the wings of many tiny species are transformed in a similar way fig 49 ac the presence of secondary features in the organization of the wings of primitive moths is also indicated by the partial loss of their venation reduction one of the anal veins as compared with ghost moths and other primitive lepidopterans considered subsequently apart from the width of the wing hinge other parameters of wing shape lack even a hypothetical functional interpretation grodnitsky 1995b as already mentioned species of many moth families secondarily evolve broad wings their origin is explained variously in diurnal ectotherms by the necessity to accumulate heat from the sun and in nocturnal endotherms by the tendency to decrease the energy expenditures of a nonfeeding imago with reduced mouthparts sec 38 nevertheless comparison of diurnal and nocturnal broadwinged lepidopterans from different families reveals significant similarity of the wings planform including secondary marginal projections fig 410 analogous examples can be presented on the lanceolate wing shape typical of tiny caddisflies and moths fig 49ac and unusual in other orders but characteristic of the moth flies psychodidae fig 49h and the spearwinged flies lonchopteridae these convergent features however are presently unexplainable from the perspective of functional similarity 423 transformation of venation initially caddisflies and moths were insects of medium size with wingspans of 1015 mm sukacheva 1982 kozlov 1988 during the course of evolution the body size of different groups increased or decreased which considerably influenced the historical trajectory of

a considerable decrease in wing size gorodkov 1984 fig 49 for example the longitudinal veins of both caddisflies and moths partially disappear after the wing becomes shorter than 3 to 4 mm grodnitsky 1991a a threshold value below which the inherent mechanical properties of the cuticle are sufficient to provide the necessary wing strength with partial or even complete vein reduction vein reduction can also be explained by a general embryologic regularity the decrease in absolute size of a vestige below a particular limit prevents differentiation of the vestige lande 1978 alberch 1980 alberch and gale 1985 beloussov 1987 oster et al 1988 cross sections of insect wings reveal that a vein that is being reduced gradually loses its initially tubular structure and becomes flatter its walls get thinner and sclerotization decreases finally only a comex or concave gutterlike relief structure remains in the adjacgnt mee after which the vein disappears completely thus the reduced wing venation of tiny insects offers an illustration of the collaborative action of additive morphogenetic and selective factors of organismal appearance various factors can influence a decrease in body size for example transition to life in a limited space inside plant leaves insect eggs etc and diminution in turn directly causes vein loss if the small wing has sufficient strength to fly without veins miniature species evolve with reduced venation if the strength had been insufficient such species would either have originated with novel special mechanisms of vein differentiation under small size or not originated at all miniaturized forms repeatedly originated in different phyletic branches of the amphiesmenoptera in each case reduction of different veins took place problems of endopterygote

rs branches is four the most frequently reduced veins on trichopteran hindwings are one to three branches of rs one to two branches of m and one of the anal veins flight in large lepidopterans is more highly developed than in caddisflies correspondingly their wings display a greater degree of transformation with any given increase in insect size the forewings of moths and butterflies have often lost one to two branches of rs one branch of m cup and 1a and 2a whereas the hindwings often lack one to four branches of rs one to two branches of m cup pcu and both la and 2a in both moths and caddisflies the hindwings have become noticeably stronger than the forewings this change reflects the presence of wing coupling mechanisms and consequently the loss of active flight function by the hindwing and the transfer of the main functional activity to the mesothorax and forewing the reduction of the posterocubital vein is extremely characteristic of moths grodnitsky 1991a in generalized species it is distinct and associated with the adjacent furrow this proximity probably makes the vein irrelevant as a strengthening element and induces its reduction on both fore and hindwings in even primitive forms this reduction occurs in the proximal part of the medial vein as well reduction of the first two anal veins on the forewings often passes through an intermediate stage in which they fuse and flow into the pcu instead of the trailing edge of the wing so that the socalled anal loop is formed figs 47 and 48 the three fused veins are always situated within the clavusthe zone separated from the rest of the wing by the concave remigioanal furrow in the front and by the convex anojugal furrow behind the anal loop is observed in the majority of caddisflies and moths from the most primitive families eriocraniidae davis 1978 davis and faeth 1986 heterobathmiidae kristensen and nielsen 1979 and agathiphagidae kristensen 1981a brodsky and ivanov 1983b suggested that

insect wings ing plant lice whiteflies and aphids coccids the loop was formed independently and simultaneously with the appearance of coupling mechanisms d e shcherbakov personal communication another assumption exists in caddisflies the anal veins lose connection with the c so that a continuous covering is formed by the left and right wings at rest as a result air can be retained under the wings and the imago obtains a novel adaptation for life underwater sukacheva 1982 none of these explanations are adequate a welldeveloped loop is present on the wings of primitive moths a suggested apomorphy of papilionida see kristensen 1984 although the wings of these insects are not coupled during flight see chap 1 and sec 38 and their imagos are not associated with aquatic habitats a similar structure was found on the forewings of some walking sticks ragge 1955 which are functionally fourwinged primarily terrestrial insects the loop also occurs on the hindwings of fossil and recent caddisflies novokshonov 1992 recent lepidopterans grodnitsky 1991a and hymenopterans fig 44a c this fact lacks even a preliminary adaptive explanation the previous considerations cannot be allowed as refutation of the existing interpretations of anal loop function because there is no evidence to deny that in one taxon it serves as strengthening of the wing whereas in another it constitutes an adaptation for an amphibiotic mode of life however these functional interpretations can only explain the conservation of a loop that had already emerged the question of the origination of novel features is of much greater importance to evolutionary theory than explanations of their subsequent maintenance maynard smith 1978 lubischew 1982 a sclerotization is located in the jugal regions of the wings of primitive species martynov 1924b 1925 showed that the hindwing jugum plays an important role in the evolution of the flapping surface of insects while the jugal elements vena cardinalis and v arcuata according to martynov develop into true tubular veins that reach the wing edge fig 41 the existence of expressed jugal venation was also recognized by later investigators snodgrass 1935 shwanvich 1949 sharov 1968 however the independence of the jugal relative to the anal veins has not been conclusively proved as a rule both the anal and the jugal veins depart from a single basement separated by the anojugal furrow in the majority of species into two interrelated parts this is a usual argument for contrasting anal venation to jugal meanwhile in some caddisflies eg in brachycentrus subnubilus curt brachycentridae and ganonema extensum mart calamoceratidae the furrow passes in front problems of endopterygote insect wing functional mology i 137 of the hinge and does not divide it thus it is more reasonable to agree with rasnitsyn 1969 that the jugal veins result from secondary differentiation of the anal system and designate v cardinalis as 3a fig 45 furthermore there is no reason to deprive v arcuata the axillary cord according to rasnitsyn of the status of an independent vein in lepidopterans it has been lost but on the hindwings of many caddisflies it is sclerotized quite well developed and can be termed 4a fig 45b the jugal region of the phryganeida and the papilionida occasionally underwent evolutionary changes related to specialization for different functions comstock 1918 thought that the elongated jugums of ghost moth forewings served as coupling with the hindwings martynov 1924b disagreed claiming that jugums were structurally too weak it is now clear that martynov was correct because the wings of primitive moths are not coupled and work separately inflight sec 12 and 38 consequently the jugum does not act as a part of a coupling mechanism the jugal region of the forewings is lost in some caddisflies and in the majority of lepidopterans evolution of jugums on the hindwings was somewhat different cinefilming and photographic surveys of the flight of lepidopterans and caddisflies show that the hindwing jugums are almost motionless relative to the body during the course of a stroke cycle basically strokes are executed about the axis passing through the axillary apparatus and anojugal furrow therefore the hindwing jugum is in fact outside of the flapping surface and does not directly generate aerodynamic force the jugum probably blocks airflgw between the flappin surface and the abdojllen owing to differences of pressure over and under the body such a flow would originate in the absence of a jugum and reduce lift a broadened anojugal zone is used in an alternative manner by many butterflies of the superfamily papilionoidea their jugum bears a specialized twolayer scale covering that consists in part of shiny lightreflecting scales the jugums adhere to the abdomen at rest and to some degree during flight thereby functioning as insulators to prevent heat loss from the insects body a single vein is located on the rear part of the hindwings of many moths and butterflies in the zone separated by the anterior convex anojugal furrow fig 411a ce this is probably 3a which is always situated behind the convex fold line generally the third anal vein persists on the hindwing even after the reduction of la and 2a 138 i form an lction of insect wings d b a r figure 411 evolutionary

nielsen 1979 grodnitsky and kozlov 1985 davis and faeth 1986 the primitive state of the furrows also changed in respect to the different evolutionary transformations of the wings observed in the amphiesmenoptera sec 38 the furrows are often reduced in tiny species fig 49ac this reduction can be related to the featherlike wings that often originate with a decrease in absolute size sec 38 the wing becomes narrow and the flapping surface consists mostly of a long fringe which works as a solid wing ventral flexion and trapezoid deformatirnt of the wing tip have been observed in the majority of investigated caddisflies and moths although often independently of visible morphologic features thus the plume moths capperia sp and oidaematophorus sp pterophoridae possess a fundamentally identical flapping surface morphology however the first species exhibits sharp ventral bending whereas the latter displays a smooth flexion grodnitsky and morozov 1994 remarkably the fenestrae thyridium and arculus are not expressed in either species because of different ecologic reasons sec 38 an increase in body size is followed by a widening of the flapping surface in many groups of the amphiesmenoptera in the majority of cases this results in secondary furrows some of which participate in compact plaiting of the wings at rest these furrows pass from wing hinge to edge and are called general in emelianovs 1977 terminology primitive concave furrows often participate in hindwing plaiting these include p remigialis in tortricidae papilionida p remigioanalis in arctiidae papilionida phryganeidae and some calamoceratidae phryganeida and p remigialis and p remigioanalis in pyralidae crambidae phycitidae and other pyraloid lepidopterans figs 411 and 412 other furrows are situated wholly in the distal third of wings parallel to the terminal vein branches fig 48d brackenbury 1991a 1994 states that they serve for wing deformation and designates them flexion lines meanwhile his published photographs of freeflying butterflies obviously demonme s of flexion of the m furrows are not associated with any change in the flapping surface profile these furrows are apparently necessary to enhance wing strength a property that separates them from fold lines and flexion lines of different types secondary general furrows originate even in species in which body size increase

amphiesmenoptera and occurs in two alternative ways in caddisflies and lepidopterans in the phryganeida only the anojugal field of the hindwings or vannus is problems of endopterygote insect wing functional phology i 141 broadened whereas the entire forewing and the remigium of the hindwing remain relatively unchanged by contrast in the papilionida both the foreand the hindwing shape is changed in the majority of cases the widening of a flapping surface requires that it be packed compactly while inoperative resulting in the appearance of new general furrows on the hind wings different methods of increasing wing area resulted in distinctive systems of wing plaiting in the phryganeida and papilionida therefore the evolution of the furrow systems of caddisflies and moths will be considered in turn 4241 caddisflies the wings of generalized caddisflies fold up only along one convex anojugal furrow fig 412a increase in body size and the appearance and further broadening of the hindwing vannuses led to the development of two secondary fold lines convex and concave fig 412b c their location relative to the main longitudinal veins can vary in different species for example it is possible to trace how a convex furrow first crosses the pcu then the cup and gradually approaches the cua in the series of intermediate forms apatania wallengreni mel limnephilidae silo nigricornis pict goeridae brachycentrus subnubilus curt brachycentridae and r vulgaris pict rhyacophilidae at the intersections the veins are soft and lack melanin pigmentation no cases in which the furrow crosses the cua are observed functional constraints presumably prohibit any weakening of this vein in the majority of caddisfly species the convex anal furrow crosses the concave primary p remigioanalis furrow as it shifts toward the cu this crossing results in the formation of a proximal qgltgidzone on the wing separated by the two furrows from the basal portion of the wing presumably communication of control forces from the axillary sclerites to this zone is handicapped and problematic deformation of the wing can arise during plaiting or flying furrow crossing can be avoided by eliminating one of the furrows this mechanism probably caused the reduction of the remigioanal furrow which has disappeared in many species fig 412b df a unique way to avoid crossing of the furrows was observed in ceraclea nigronervosa retz leptoceridae in this species p remigioanalis is pressed closely to the anterocubital vein and located between the cua and the secondary convex claval furrow further widening of the anojugal region results in the development of two more pairs of furrows in some caddisflies convex and concave furrows are acquired by an enlarged clavus fig 412d in phryganeida with a 142 i form anu zction of insect wings broader jugum two new jugal furrows one convex and one concave appear fig 412 finally in caddisflies with the widest vannus the hindwing at rest folds up along all seven of the described furrows fig 412f all the wing plaiting systems modifications described in the foregoing have a common basis because the control of hindwing folding is carried out by the upward turn of the distal arm of 3ax the mechanical effort is transmitted from the sclerite to the base of 2a which has a bend in its proximal part all furrows that participate in wing folding begin from this bend fig 412b c e f the plaiting of the flapping surface is achieved in a different manner in the family phryganeidae as well as in other species in those caddisflies the folding effort is transmitted from 3ax through the base of the pcu rather than via 2a fig 412g in contrast to the first case this folding system incorporates the concave p remigioanalis furrow which secondarily participates in wing plaiting further development of a flapping surface of the phryganeid type leads to the formation of one more pair of furrows convex and concave fig 412h thus two systems of plaiting of the anojugal zone are found in caddisflies differing by the point of application control forces in the proximal part of the wing different location of furrows affects the venation of the basal area in the first case the proximal parts of the pcu and la are often reduced whereas formation of the second type of folding system can be followed by loss of the la and 2a bases nevertheless in both cases formation of a morphologically similar structure takes place namely the vein proximal bend that transmits force from 3ax to the furrows 4242 moths the hindwings at rest fold up only along the anojugal furrow in generalized moths fig 411a exactly as they do in caddisflies a modification of this plaiting system is found in the wasp moth syntomis phygea l syntomidae whose hindwings bear p anojugalis beginning behind the anal vein base then declining forward and crossing la coming onto the wing margin just behind p remigioanalis fig 411b consequently wasp moths possess a plaiting system similar to that of many caddisflies a broadening of the moth flapping surface results first in the appearance of the secondary claval convex general furrow while the wings acquire the ability to bend also along the primary concave p remigioanalis that is along the furrow that initially performed a strictly aerodynamic function without participating in plaiting fig 411c broadening of the remigium is accom problems of endopterygote insect wing functional mirrphology i 143 panied by the formation of an additive convex remigial furrow that passes anterior to the primary concave p remigialis fig 411d finally up to five furrows occur in species with the most welldeveloped wing folding system fig 411 these furrows sometimes in various combinations are characteristic of many of the tortricidae crambidae pyralidae choreutidae limacodidae noctuidae arctiidae lymantriidae and other moths that fold up their hindwings at rest thus the methods of wing plaiting differ considerably in caddisflies and moths reflecting each orders characteristic manner of broadening the flapping surface 43 wing morphology in neuropterans scorpion flies and the hypothetical ancestor of the amphiesmenoptera the functional organization of the wings of the myrmeleontida and panorpida is quite similar and corresponds to the most primitive anteromotoric

recent species the wings of scorpion flies and neuropterans are connected to the body with a narrow hinge in many forms the hinges are further narrowed so that the jugal angle of the wings completely disappears this feature is not specific to caddisflies and lepidopterans but can be considered a homoplasy evolving in many different insect groups the primitive state of amphiesmenopteran venation is in all likelihood similar to the construction of the wings of fossil caddisflies sukacheva 1982 and recent scorpion flies they are characterized by comblike sc r with fourbranched sector m with two major branches each also divided into two veins fore and hind cubituses pcu and two anal veins many veins especially the remigial may bear additional terminal bifurcations the wings of papilionida may be completely derived from the construction of wings of recent primitive phyganeida and differ in general only by the absence of m4 on forewingsprimitive for moths kozlov 1988 the presence of m4 in lepidopterans belonging to the family agathiphagidae kristensen 1981a is probably a secondary feature repeating the ancestral condition furrows present on the wings of generalized caddisflies and moths reflect the initial construction of the wings of the amphiesmenopteran ancestor and their presence may be primitive for all winged insects the wings of the pterygota probably acquired the ability to fold up before the evolution 144 i form and _ tion of insect wings of active flapping flight sec 31 simultaneously the anojugal furrow had to originate the appearance of two concave primary furrows remigial and remigioanal could occur somewhat later in close relation with the formation of flapping flight thus the wings of ancestors of the pterygota needed to bear three lines of deformation p remigialis p remigioanalis and p anojugalis this hypothesis is partly supported by the configuration of the marginal edge of the wings of early fossil insects in fact in recent species the lcation of urow and ostal vein conetion is often mrked by an incisi fig 41a c fig 48a b fig 411a d e fig 412e g th1s presumably facilitates wing deformation along the furrows similar incisions are located very close to the end of the cup on the wings of carboniferous paoliida rasnitsyn 1980 providing evidence for the presence of the concave remigioanal furrow on the wing and hence of flapping flight in paoliid insects in the myrmeleontida and panorpida the remigial and remigioanal furrows of the fore and hindwings are poorly developed and can only be seen close to the hinge being absolutely invisible in their distal parts fig 46 remigial furrows in panorpa communis l are almost imperceptible bifurcation of the medial vein in the scorpion fly is represented by considerably weakened parts of veins and is analogous to the thyridium the fenestrum on caddisfly and lepidopteran wings the cross veins of the distal half of the wings are also weakened fig 46b this can favor the formation of a gradual concave profile observed in these insects during their second halfcycle grodnitsky and morozov 1994 in general the neuropterans and scorpion flies possess features of primitive organization and a quite strong similarity can be seen between them and the hypothetical ancestor of the endopterygote insects fig 16 in addition lacewings and especially scorpion flies are characterized by a et of apparently secondary features that determine the relatively weak deformation of wings that is most likely functionally connected with the apomorphic narrowing of the wing hinges 44 wing morphology in dipterous flies muscida wings can be considered as monofunctional structures since they are not used in thermoregulation for defensive purposes or for other flight modes besides flapping hence the wing shape in dipterous flies must be essentially close to the optimal condition defined by the function of flapping flight accordingly the planform of dipteran wings is considerably more uni problems of endopterygote insect wing functional morphology i 145 form throughout the order than in the related groupsthe orders phryganeida and papilionida vein homology of dipteran wings will be discussed using the system proposed by wuotton a1fifuillg_129 to homologize venation elements they used the arrangement of furrows and showed that the vein located behind the cua and generally designated as cup is in fact a false vein represented by a sclerotized gutter rather than a tube let us consider the problem of the origination of false veins muscida wings often bear secondaq reliefgutterlike sbllctllres such as the prcubita thkkelling and petip of caddisflies moths and butterflies it is quite common in entomology to associate formation of such structures with the necessity of wing strengthening ussatchov 1970 wootton 1981 brodsky and ivanov 1983b kukalovapeck and lawrence 1993 this viewpoint is natural in respect to dipterous flies with their high stroke frequency gutters formed by thg_brane are situated before the m in ptychoptera lacustris mg ptychopteridae fig 43b in hybomitra pavlovskii ols tabanidae fig 43d and in many other horse and deer flies after the min ischirosyrphus glaucius l syrphidae fig 43g before them and before the cu in tachina magnicornis zett tachinidae fig 43h and in the anal zone in mosquitoes of the genus aedes fig 49g in many cases thesegut ters are strengthened through mditiyejhickeningandsclemtizajiort of the membrane thereby acquiring similarity with veins a wellknown example is the extra vein verunaugia most distinctly expressed in flower flies syrphidae fig 43g and in some phantom crane flies ptychopteridae notably sclerotization of the v spuria can vary considerably between different flower flies it is strong in chrysotoxum eristalis syrphus sensu stricto eriozona and posthosyrphus and much weaker in sphegionoides temnostoma ischirosyrphus epistrophe and helophilus this interspecific variability of the false vein probably reflects different degrees of secondary modification of an initially unsclerotized gutter extra veins never have tubular structure they can be either convex as v spuria or concave as the false vein locating after the cu although it seems logical to explain the appearance of additive relief as a mechanism to increase wing strength this analysis encounters contradictions structures similar to false veins are also present in smalland even in the smallestforms whose wings are sufficiently strong for flapping flight without venation as already noted lepidopterans and caddisflies begin to lose veins when the wing length decreases below 3 to 4 mm the greatest 146 i form and fu wn of insect wings degree of reduction typifies tiny wasps fig 49k thrips many rhynchote insects and some dipterous flies fig 431 fig 49e however the venation of dipterous flies is in general quite conservative and is not necessarily reduced at miniaturization in some nematoceran dipterous flies the wings bear additional corrugation which sometimes obtains additional sclerotization in biting midges ceratopogonidae fig 49j and blackflies simuliidae fig 491 medial veins are located close to the cu and altogether form a single stiffening rib of characteristic shape this structure can be seen most distinctly in midges chironomidae fig 49f being a diagnostic feature of the family midges evidently possess one or several secondary veins all the veins are brought together in pairs with a thick pigmented membrane between them similar structures obviously have adaptive nature in larger insects but the selective value of these structures in tiny forms is highly disputable the opposite rather is true because extra sclerotization makes the wings heavier and demands more energy thus these structures are inadaptive in small insects many advanced muscida as well as vespida and scarabaeida are characterized by the reduction of costal vein fragments not observed in the amphiesmenoptera in flies the rear part of the c is often absent beginning from the place of its connection with them or rs fig 43c e gi fig 49d f i thus the anal wing edge consists of membrane the rear part of the c is also lost in many beetles and can even be absent on much of the leading edge fig 42b c the same is characteristic of hymenopterans fig 44 the reduction of the c is exhibited in the majority of and also restricted to insects with relatively high wingbeat frequency see fig 33 accordingly it can be assumed that costal reduction is caused by one of the two following selective factors 1 acceleratiqn_oilqy over the wing surface leads to botmdalydayer thi thereby enabling interactiqjlqgtuyng sjfacetrjis and the fl_gw the latter is most likely aerodynamically disadvantageous see sec 483 hence natural selection favors the decrlefil1kiqughness in the parts wherg_jlirilts_ th rrl_ostlpid causingimgithe_jeillt of the costaljrein so that

measured or calculated can be estimated according to the size of the surface structure projections on an insects wings 2 the frequency increase leads to the growth of inertial loading experi problems of endopterygote insect wing functional mo _jlogy i 147 enced by wings at the points of trajectory reversal therefore adaptive significance of the decrease of wing mass grows with stroke frequency and induces the reduction of the costal vein as the bearing element of least importance from my viewpoint the second cause is more likely since the costal vein j can also be lost in wing parts that do not contact the airflow for example on l the rear edge of the forewings in hymenopterans fig 44 however there lationship of the factors of reduction is still uncertain and final conclusions are not yet possible the primary furrows of dipterous flies are strongly or completely reduced fig 43 the remigial furrow fig 43c can be seen only in a minority of species a welldeveloped remigioanal furrow can often be found near the wing hinges fig 43a e g h but a completely developed p remigioanalis fig 43b is quite rare the convex anojugal furrow is present in all species but is very short and thus almost imperceptible departing from the 3ax the jugum is situated behind it sometimes rudimentary fig 43a sometimes modified and transformed into socalled upper and lower cazypteres fig 43d significance of the calypteres for flight is unclear as already noted derivatives of the wings jugal lobe also play no role in the flight of diurnal butterflies sec 423 and hemipterans wootton 1996 calypteres rather are the morphologic consequence of the formation of the narrow wing hinges the wings of dipterous flies are connected to the body by narroften very narrow rodlike stalks this is the most probable reason for the reduction of furrows and the decrease in wing deformation the rear edge of the stalk in many species carries a _cle that can be found in aedes fig 49g anisopus plecia and others in the majority of the muscida brachycera this plate is increased separated from the stalk by a broad fold line and called the a1jjjlfja3ch behavior of the alula during the stroke cycle was described in section 39 presumably the articulated alula had multiple origins during the evolution of the muscida this can be ascertained by the absence of the alula in part of brachycera from different families stratiomyidae bombyliidae asilidae leptogastridae platypezidae see for example l cervi l hippoboscidae fig 43i interestingly the structures participating in the control of airflow in fourwinged insects are normally situated on the rear part of the hindwings thus the wings of muscida simultaneously bear both the fore and hindwing features of fourwinged insects fenra_e__ in

specific morphology of the wings of the mountain midges deuterophlebiidae deserves mention larvae of these insects live in alpine creeks and the imagos swarm close to the water surfaces bk1285 jedlicka 1986 turngrfelj286 their wings bear a welldeomrllg_ilqf furrgoccasionally called secotldacy_ veins see jedlicka and halgos 1981 these furrows help plait the wings inside the puparium brodsky k a 1930 they do not operate in the imago in addition they apparently impart additional strength to the wings so that venation becomes irrelevant and is strongly reduced fig 413b the forewing folding system found in mountain midges is similar to that of earwigs fig 413a and represents one of the most surprising examples of convergent similarity in insect wings 45 wing morphology in beetles the

designations introduced in their paper from my viewpoint there is no evidence supporting the theory that the convex furrow separating the proximoanal wing part that is folded up while plaiting is anything other than p anojugalis correspondingly the most pidyerlulyeiilthalpasalong __ the rear bord_glojjqijljgllrpa_rlllhidgltllcl1a these designations are accepted in figure 42 note however that beetle wings bear very diverse secondary sclerotization expressed as fields that are not shown in the figure homologization of the clavus veins is problematic because they are very often weakened and morphologically identical to the false veins of other insects therefore the structural scheme of this wing region has considerable individual variability for example 16 anomalies can be recognized in the venation of chlorophorus faldermanni fald 21 in xylotrechus namanganensis heyd cerambycidae chikatunov and kriukova 1985 and 42 in entomoscelis adonidis pall chrysomelidae 18 of which are abundant chikatunov and denisova 1988 ordinarily the size of the wings considerably exceeds the size of the elytra in the scarabaeida hence they have secondarily acquired furrows along which the wings are folded up at rest fig 42 according to available data this system of hind wing plaiting developed independently in the many groups of this order resulting in extremely diverse folding systems furrows problems of endopterygote insect wing functional drphology i 151 can therefore be homologized only after detailed comparative research the available data poijliillarenko 172 schneider 1978 kukalovapeck and lawrejlce1993 zherikhin and gratshev 1995 are insufficient for this purpose hence the majority of furrows herein remctiiljld only p anojugalis always convex and departing from 3ax can consistently be recognized to a lesser degree this is true of concave p remigioanalis the remigial furrow and noduiie are difficult to identify since within particular sections they change their sign and alter from concave to convex and vice versa because they are corrugated structures furrows increase wing strength the systenlqlfurrows_is constructed so that the wing possesses only jwo sta2ltate__jjead ang fol_cieg __p furrows impart such a stiffness to the wing that during the stroke cycle the remigium the zone within which most of the furrows are located flexes neither in the longitudinal nor in the transverse direction sec 37 the ability of furrows to impart additional strength to the wing coincides well with the previously mentioned case of the deuterophlebiidae wing morphology in which the system of furrows partially substitutes for venation any apparent correlation between the degree of anatomic expression of furrows and inflight wing deformation is generally absent for example in monochamus urussovi fisch m sutor l corymbia rubra l cerambycidae mordellistena tournieri emery mordellidae and cetonia aurata l scarabaeidae the wings flex along the p remigioanalis in the second halfstroke in cassida sp chrysomelidae and trichius fasciatus l scarabaeidae they do not although the furrow is well developed in all the mentioned beetles on the other hand in species having no anatomically expressed p remigioanalis clavus flexion is observed in cicindela restricta carabidae and in oedemera sp oedemeridae and absent in coccinella trifasciata l coccinellidae and lagria sp lagriidae grodnitsky and morozov 1994 this is also true of the configuration of the folded wing condition the wing can be folded along lines that are imperceptible on spread wilgs in general a folded wing has considerably more lines of deformation than anatomically expressed fold lines suggesting that wing plaiting originates first during evolution followed by the development of specialized morphologic structures such as furrows 46 wing morphology in hymenopterans remigioanal furrows are distinctly expressed on both the fore and hindwings of vespida a long or short anojugal furrow dependent on jugum 152 i form and lion of insect wings size is always present although the furrow is practically imperceptible if the jugum is very small as in the muscida the p remigialis is not visible on either the fore or the hindwings even in the ancestral condition rasnitsyn 1969 1980 despite this absence both wing pairs of most species of vespida generally bend during upstroke at the sites where the p remigialis and p remigioanalis would pass grodnitsky and morozov 1994 in some species the remigial furrows become secondarily pronounced through thickening and pigmentation of the surrounding membrane examples include the hindwings of ceropales sp ceropalidae acantholyda nemoralis thomson pamphilidae pseudogonalos hahni spin trigonalidae and chrysis sp chrysididae and both wing pairs of t femorata f tiphiidae fig 44d the forewings of tiphia and chrysis possess secondary furrows of unclear function many species bend their wings along the convex nodaiiili this line can be traced according to fenestrae on veins that usually are present and homologous to the thyridium and arculus of caddisflies and moths besides these two fenestrae bullae on cross veins occur in the places where the veins intersect with invisible p remigialis and visible p remigioanalis bullae can also be located in places free of furrows by contrast the cross veins of u gigas l siricidae are almost completely deprived of fenestrae fig 44b although its flapping surface flexes along definite lines during flight fig 37a thus in the vespida just like in other insects frequent cases can be found of a discrepancy between morphology and flight deformation of the wings plaiting of the flapping surface of higher hymenopterans is performed in a manner unusual for scarabaeiformes a single secondary convex furrow is situated on the forewing unlike in any other insect group this furrow has connection with 3ax this peculiarity probably permits the fur_mw to change the signof its profile from convex to concave during upstroke bxackenhury j 111294 polarity change is extremely rare in insect wing furrows and is generally prohibited by mechanical properties of the wing hinge in addition the concave fold line corresponds to fore and hindwing coupling or in pompilidae to p remigioanalis danfblthugmichenel12_88 have described similar plaiting in detail for several families of wasps as well as for bees eulonchoptera colletidae they have also derived a direct correlation between the presence of the convex furrow and the fenestra on the last cross vein situated between the m and cua the latter is incorrect as some problems of endopterygote insect wing functional mm ogy i 153 hymenopterans for example rhogogaster sp tenthredinidae fig 44a possess a bulla on the indicated vein although the wings do not fold up at rest tobias 1992 1993 considers natural selection to be directly responsible for transformations of venation observed in the ichneumonoidea sphecoidea and apoidea within these groups species that live in open arid biotopes have wing veins that are shifted proximally tobias 1992 1993 suggests that strong winds eliminate weakly flying specimens and thus improve the flight performance of inhabitants of open spaces this interpretation is disputable because in dipterous flies just the opposite tendency is observed perfection of their flight is accompanied not by a proximal but by a distal shift of wing venation ussatchov 1970 stary 1990 on the other hand rasnitsyn 1969 suggested that veins shift toward the base and leading edge of wings this process is called costalization under a decrease in absolute size of specimens this hypothesis has not been falsified and also deserves mentioning 47 morphology and functions of furrows insect furrows are more diverse than veins venation inherited from ancestors can change in evolution within some limits in most cases the changes are related to oligomerization that is reduction of some veins and reinforcement of others polymerization of venation reported for archaic groups rasnitsyn 1980 has rarely been observed in advanced taxa ordinarily only false veins are formed secondarily a lost vein never returns if natural selection demands strengthening of a particular wing zone it is achieved by means of corrugation thickening and sclerotization of the membrane unaccompanied by formation of new true tubular veins veins can develop only from tubular vestiges available in ancestors as they do in the case of jugal venation in many taxa sec 423 martynov 1924b snodgrass 1935 shwanvich 1949 sharov 1968 rasnitsyn 1969 the following types of furrows can be recognized 1 anatomically ed lines olflighldefwmation this type of fur row can be seen on the spread wing because it differs from the surrounding membrane by its relief andjor color owing to desclerotization or lesser thickness anatomically expressed furrows include the primary concave furrows p

inflight deformation nodal line in all insects except beetles p remigialis in hymenopterans the line of trapezoid deformation in caddisflies and moths the arrangement of furrows of this type can be traced by the arrangement of the microtrichia which often have another size or form on the furrow differing from the microtrichia on neighboring plots of the wing often but far from necessarily furrows pass through breaks in the veins that is bullae or fenestrae which is the same 3 anillomically expressed lines of bending that work at plaifulg in these furrows it is unknown how consistently innertension exists ihalfolds up twalesl the anojugal fold line in all insects is a typical example of this furrow type as are many of the secondary furrows present in beetles caddisflies and moths 4

furrows these structures do not participate in wing deformation but instead represent a type somewhat different from the previous four they should probably be designated by a term other than furrow in all likelihood the first four types of furrows are interconvertible thus in the majority of the amphiesmenoptera p remigialis belongs to type 1 in pyraloid lepidopterans to 3 and in hymenopterans to 2 again p remigioanalis on hindwings is generally type 1 whereas in the caddisfly family phryganeidae in some calamoceratidae in moths arctiidae pyralidae pyraustidae crambidae and in the honeybee fig 44c it is type 3 therefore the term furrow corresponds to at least five morphologically and functionally different structures this is the first and hence a quite hesitant attempt to build a furrow typology according to the general considerations sec 421 see also under multivariate correspondence between structures and functions in the appendix classification must be based either on morphologic or functional characters in the case of furrows these can include features of surface microstructures or inner morphology of the folded membrane its thickness and presencegflasticprteii1 unfortunately no comparative survey on furrow morphology has ever been undertaken let alone conducted furrows like other membranous structures originate in the course of evolution quite easily this can be seen from the basic difference of the con problems of endopterygote insect wing functional morphology i 155 sidered systems of wing plaiting found in different groups of endopterygote insects moreover in each order not one but several different methods of plaiting can be found finally an impression can be derived that during insect wing evolution a change of adaptive strategies took place because polymerization of venation has been substituted by the development of new furrows it is difficult to unequivocally indicate why furrows developed more easily than veins furrows are possibly more functionally adjustable than veins as factors of changeable corrugation a vein can serve solely as a stiffening element of construction a furrow eg lonitudinal enables deformation of the wjng profile simultaneously preventing the wing from bendingjn the tiasoction furrows also weigh considerably less than veins in addition a system of furrows of definite configuration as occurs in beetles causes greater wing stiffness which cannot be provided by veins unless they are thick enough thus each furrow can play several roles causing inflight deformation of wings their plaiting at rest and an increased wing stiffness or resistance to flexible deformations in various insects each role is fulfilled by a different combination of furrows and fenestrae and can sometimes be satisfied without both structures consequently furrows and their functions appear to be connected by multivariate correspondence fig a2b l 48 lepidopteran wing scale covering the presence of a solid covering of scales constitutes the most characteristic feature of the papilionida order to a great extent the covering has conditioned and channeled the evolutionary transformations of moth and butterfly wings preventing an increase in stroke frequency types of covering are related to the development of complex mechanisms of thermoregulation that admit two alternative adaptive strategies sec 38 meanwhile

4821 orientation of scales orientation of the scale tips is uniform in primitive moths since all the scales are situated along the basoapical axis of the wing and only decline slightly toward the nearest edge in ghost moths the wings possess a wellexpressed tornal angle and the scales are oriented in a fanlike manner crossing veins problems of endopterygote insect wing functional morphology i

scales is analogous to that of micropterigdae and eriocraniidae the direction of scales in large forms coincides as a rule with the direction of the nearest veins only the scales that are adjacent to a vein are situated under an acute angle to it covering the vein with their vertices the scales can overlap subcostal and radial veins under small angles within the costal field of the lower wing surface orienting toward the wing tip grodnitsky 1988 elements of a wings color pattern can control the initial orientation of the scales for example in the field of eyelike patterns displayed on the wings of swallowtail butterflies of the genera archon and parnassius elongated scales surround the core of the pattern departing prior to it and then meeting again fig 415 4822 rows of scales scales in primitive lepidopterans are not ordered a state that can be considered primitive for the order in the majority of butterflies the scale sockets 158 i form and ction of insect wings as well as the scales themselves are arranged in tranverse rows the rows of neighboring cells of the wing come to the vein that separate them under obtuse angle so that the rows on the entire wing are oriented along secants of concentric circles with the wing hinge as the center yoshida et al 1983 this orientation pattern is violated only in bands of one to three scales adjoining veins and wing margins where the scales are longer and their tips are to the side of the vein or wing margin the carpenter moths cossidae whose scales and scale sockets are not put in order grodnitsky and kozlov 1989a provide a unique exception scales do not form transverse rows in small narrowwinged moths such an arrangement can be primitive or secondary scale sockets in lappet moths are arranged in order but the scale tips appear to be disordered owing to a size polymorphism of the scales grodnitsky and kozlov 1990a within a family the covering can be ordered to various degrees for example the rows are expressed distinctly in swallowtail butterflies of the subfamily papilioninae in the subfamily parnassiinae the covering is more diverse in bhutanitis thaidina bland the rows are as well expressed as in papilioninae in serecinus telamon don allancastria cerisyi god and luehdorfia puzioli ersch they are less distinct and in the tribe parnassiini the scales are not arranged in rows and even the scale sockets are scattered chaotically on the wing membrane grodnitsky and kozlov 1989b however note that among swallowtail butterflies the transverse rows of scales are well expressed in species with long tails on the hindwings bhutanitis serecinus papilio parides iphiclides exceptions include some species of papilio and all species of ornithoptera which have rows but not tails the rows are much less distinct in allancastria and luehdorfia with small tails species of the tribe parnassiini possess neither tails nor rows the covering of the tails themselves does not differ from the covering of the

fig 416c note however that these are strictly terms of convenience since the covering has no layers in the direct meaning of this word the covering of primitive lepidopterans is characterized by a state that is the most primitive within the order kristensen 1970 the wings of micropterix calthella l micropterigidae are covered by uniform scales among which larger and hairlike scales can be found the forewing of eriocrania semipurpurella stph eriocraniidae bears the same covering as mandibulate moths but its hind wings are covered with scattered narrow elongated scales the shape of the distribution of scale lengths in the majority of lepidopteran taxa is similar to that in primitive moths the covering structure does not vary or only varies slightly for a particular wing region furthermore primitive groups already display specialization of the covering for example scale distribution in the ghost moths hepialidae is described by an excessively peaked curve and distribution is bimodal in the fairy moths adelidae this demonstrates that different modifications of the wing covering have repeatedly originated in the course of evolution of the order the suggested scheme fig 417 reflects the most likely routes of the covering transformation the decrease in scale size polymorphism observed in the hepialidae pieridae and papilionidae corresponds to the formation of a singlelayer covering by contrast the increase in scale variability leads to development of a multilayer covering with the curve of distribution becoming stretched along the horizontal axis such a covering structure characterizes most species belonging to the superfamilies pyraloidea bombycoidea hesperioidea and partly papilionoidea lycaenidae the covering of the geometroidea reflects an intermediate stage of the development of multilayer covering intermediate scales are reduced in the nymphalidae satyridae and the majority of the lasiocampidae and the covering is formed by the scales of two size categories having equal functional capacities such covering has less mass and consequently reduced wing inertia the process of twolayer covering origination can be traced using the families lasiocampidae and thaumetopoeidae tab 41 generic names according to fletcher and nye 1982 as an example the multilayer covering typical of the bombycoid complex reflects the initial state for

scales of intermediate length the length distribution curve acquires a second maximum distribution of the number of teeth remains unchanged and is described by a onevertex curve tab 41 amuriella dieckmanni graeser paralebeda plagifera walk etc next partial reduction of the scales of intermediate length is accompanied by morphologic divergence between large and small scales the curve of teeth number distribution also becomes twovertex tab 41 gastropacha quercifolia l arguda vinata moore etc in these species the wing covering consists of large scales with one to three teeth and small scales with four to eight teeth scales with few teeth are almost fully hidden under scales with more numerous teeth grodnitsky and kozlov 1990a that is the covering is divided into overlapping and underlying parts the long teeth of the underlying scales facilitate intercalation of air between the layers table 41 modifications of wing scale covering in lappet moths lasiocampidae and thaumetopoeidae teeth

scales contribute up to 912 of the common sample whereas in g quercifolia l trichiura crataegi l metanastria hyrtaca cramer and in other species characterized by the previous stage of covering differentiation the intermediate scales contribute up to 1525 complete morphologic differentiation of the covering is achieved with the replacement of the large scales of the upper layer with hairs underlying scales are small and the overlapping layer is presented by hairs tab 41 thaumetopoea solitaria phyllodesma ilicifolia l etc during the next stage of the evolution of covering one of the layers is reduced thus in thaumetopoea iordana stgr scales on wings are scarce constituting no more than 25 of the covering and the covering itself is basically formed by hairs as in the majority of caddisflies by contrast in some species hairs are reduced tab 41 poecilocampa populi l etc the covering consists of scales with very long teeth and therefore looks practically identical to the caddisflytype covering distributions of teeth number and scale lengths in these groups are described by onevertex curves both cases of reduction produce the same external result the wings of the moths become halftransparent note however that blank cells in table 41 indicate that there can exist species of lappet moths with a covering structure corresponding to empty classes 4824 differentiation of the covering as a function of wing zone in the superfamilies noctuoidea notodontoidea sphingoidea and lasiocampoidea the development of a multilayer covering is accompanied by its differentiation within the wing surface the flat scalesize distribution curve indicates a multilayer structure of the covering near the wing base farther from the wing articulation the covering is formed by more uniform scales and gradually acquires a singlelayer structure and the curve displays a narrow peak fig 417c additionally unlike in other groups of lepidopterans the mean scale length decreases toward the edge of the wing surface simultaneously the angle of inclination of the scales to the wing membrane noticeably changes therefore the total wing thickness including scale covering of the moths

lappet moths the covering of some wing parts differs by the degree of differentiation into overlapping and underlying scales thus in c sordida ersch scale length and number of teeth distributions are described by a twovertex curve in any zone of the wing fig 417d the covering of g quercifolia l is also subdivided into two layers in any forewing region although close to the external margin both layers are presented by two to fourteeth scales whereas at the wing base and discal cell the overlapping layer consists of one to twoteeth scales and the underlying scales are three to six teeth the most significant differences in the construction of covering in different wing areas are observed in m hyrtaca cramer within the proximal third of the wing the covering is twolayer and the underlying and overlapping scales differ in size and shape closer to the distal third of the wing the covering becomes increasingly uniform near the outer margin it consists of problems of endopterygote insect wing functional morphology i 165 scales whose size and shape are described by onevertex curves as in noctuid moths prominents and hawkmoths the scale covering of the fore and hindwing probably did not differ initially however even in mandibulate moths the scales are narrower and scarcer on the hindwings than on the forewings the hindwing covering is also somewhat different in some eriocraniid moths grodnitsky and kozlov 1985 in many brushfooted butterflies the covering on the forewings is twolayer whereas their hindwings bear a singlelayer covering in the main part and a twolayer one with inclusion of opalescent scales on the anojugal lobe that adjoins the abdomen according to available data most lepidopterans have a scarcer covering of scales on the hind wings than on the forewings the coverings of the upper and lower wings sides also differ in primitive moths micropterigidae eriocraniidae psychidae the lower side of the forewings is covered by considerably narrower scales than the upper the lower wing surface of parnassius is covered by scattered hairlike scales except in the region that has a colored pattern the distribution of scale lengths can also display differing patterns the upper wing surface of hawkmoths has a covering in the central region similar to that near the wing tip on the lower surface the covering of the central zone closely resembles that of the proximal part of the wing in functionally twowinged lepidopterans parts of the forewings lower side and hindwings upper side overlap in flight the covering of these parts generally differs from neighboring zones by scale size shape and orientation in the overlapping zone scales are never arranged in transverse rows scale covering of this wing part is denser scales on the forewing lower surface often acquire a lanceolate shape and orient toward the pcu rather than toward the wing edge the scale covering of the hindwing leading edge also becomes denser although the scale orientation is unchanged these peculiarities of s_cale covering apparenxjecougting a couplinmshanism note however that similar transformations of covering change of orientation shortening and relative thickening of microstructures in the regions of overlapping of the fore and hindwings also occur in caddisflies for example p bipunctata retz oligotricha striata l phryganeidae g pellucidus retz a laevis zett c villosa f parachiona picicornis pict limnephilidae c nigronervosa retz leptoceridae and many others the covering often undergoes significant differentiation in respect to color patterns thus structural coloration of the wings of lycaenid butterflies 166 i form ana _ iction of insect wings changes the primary ground plan of the covering construction the blue coloration of the upper side of male wings of polyommatus coridon poda polyornrnatus amandus schn polyommatus daphnis den et schiff and celastrina argiolus l is formed exclusively by small rounded scales whereas large scales are nearly absent in this area for example in p coridon poda the scales of the blue spots are rounded whereas the brown pigment pattern adjoining the wing margin and veins is formed by small intermediate and large scales like the covering of the lower wing surface grodnitsky 1988 the covering within pigmented regions of the forewings becomes multilayered in some species of papilioninae papilio ormenus guer p ulysses l p penelope wall p ybecatheus wall these parts of the wings do not display the arrangement of scales in rows generally typical of the subfamily strong changes of the covering structure are seen in the eyelike pattern in the parnassiinae fig 415 light spots on the wings completely lack scales and hairs in some of the syntomidae lethe eumolphus ev melanthus sp etc and the spots themselves may be colored white or yellow by pigment contained in the wing membrane 483 functions of the covering the experimental removal of scales from the body and wings of lepidopterans has demonstrated that the scale covering possesses pronounced heatinsulating properties equivalent to mammalian hair avian feathers or the best manmade heatinsulating materials church 1960 heinrich 1970 1993 heinrich and bartholomew 1971 ivlev 1993a 1993b the heatinsulating capacity of this covering is best manifested on the pterothorax and at the wing hinges the presence of the scale covering results in a 152fold difference between the temperature of the thorax and that of the surrounding environment church 1960 some lepidopterans like many other insects are able to maintain a high up to 3745 body temperature necessary for the normal energy consumption of the pterothoracic muscles during flight heinrich and bartholomew 1972 ushatinskaya 1987 the specialization of lepidopterans at either ecto or endothermic temperature regulation influences the structure of the wing covering as well as the wing shape sec 38 taxa with generalized wings and comparatively weak flight possess a uniform scale covering across the entire wing surface and the distribution of scale lengths is described by the curve of intermedi problems of endopterygote insect wing functional morphology i 167 ate type in typically endothermic lepidopterans sphingoidea noctuoidea et al the construction of the covering changes from the base to the tip of the wing a thick covering of the basal part prevents strong heat loss through broad veins and hemolymph vessels a thin onelayer covering at the wing tip is associated with much less as compared to the proximal part heat exchange in this area heinrich 1993 and with the necessity to reduce the covering mass as the momentum of inertia grows with increasing distance from the wing hinge three factors may contribute to the near absence of a scale covering on the wings of some endothermic forms with a dirunal mode of life aegeriidae some sphingidae first these particular lepidopterans are characterized by the highest stroke frequency in the order sec 38 this regime of thoracic muscle contractions in the warm daytime may potentially cause overheating and consequent flight termination in these moths heinrich 1970 1993 in such a situation reduction of scale covering permits muscle cooling during active flight second a higher wingbeat frequency results in an increase in energy wasted in overcoming wing inertia at the upper and lower points of the stroke trajectory when the insect needs to decelerate its flapping surface and then accelerate it again in the reverse direction the loss of scales reduces the wing mass and therefore the total energy cost of flapping flight as well and finally covering reduction may aid in mimetic coloration eg imitation of wasp appearance construction of the covering of ectothermic lepidopterans as a rule is independent of the wing region the onelayer covering becomes more complex in connection with color pattern elements only in some species the covering characteristic of skippers can apparently be considered primitive for butterflies in the course of evolution it became transformed in two major directions in the nymphalidae and satyrdae the scale covering differentiates into two layers this twolayer structure probably originated as a further specialization of the covering in its role as a heat insulator the melanistic covering of satyrs and brushfooted butterflies favors even better heating of the butterflies bodies watt 1968 kayser 1985 the singlelayer wing covering of the pieridae presumably does not possess good heatinsulatory capacities the next stage of evolution of this type of covering is observed in parnassius latr the scales are so scattered that the covering is obviously unable to effectively protect the body and wings of the butterflies from cooling apparently pierid and swallowtail butterflies pos 168 i form ar mction of insect wings sess biochemical physiologic or behavioral peculiarities see the review by heinrich 1993 that compensate for the loss of the warm insulating function of the scale covering numerous hypotheses on the aerodynamic significance of scale covering have been offered scales undoubtedly interact with the air and somehow affect the condition of the boundary layer however the specific mechanisms and the degree of this effect are still unknown for example according to nachtigal 1965 1967 see also bocharovamessner 1979b scales turbulize the boundary layer and in this way improve lifttodrag ratio of the wings brodsky brodsky and vorobjov 1990 actively supports this viewpoint departing from the experimental data of vorobjov 1991 who has shown that the increase of roughness on the lower side of a mechanical wing leads to partial deceleration of flow under the wing and hence to the growth of aerodynamic force nachtigalls hypothesis demands that microscopic projections created by the covering fall outside the viscous zone of the boundary layer now let us compare lepidopterans with other flying and swimming animals and aircraft the extreme size of projections of roughness on aircraft wings at which elements of microrelief still remain within the viscous sublayer constitutes 00101 mm schlichting 1974 although the roughness of lepidopteran wings is close in value the reynolds numbers that characterize the functioning of lepidopteran wings about 10 3 are several orders less than the reynolds numbers of aircraft profiles next the hydrodynamically active scales of fastswimming sharks are 0205 mm in size bechert eta 1985 that is several times larger than the projections of scales even when they are inclined to the wing membrane at an acute angle in addition the reynolds numbers of swimming sharks are also much higher and the boundary layer of the sharks is much thinner than that of lepidopterans owing to the difference in size between these animals and also the relative viscosity of air and water additionally it is well documented that hydrodynamically effective surface structures in animals always decrease with the growth of body size kozlov 1983 that is the dependence of scale size on wing span in contrast to the presented observations fig 414 must be inverse reasoning from the presented considerations it can be suggested that the rough calculation of boundarylayer thickness by the formula for stationary flow see sec 27 gives a correct approximation the scales do not come out of the viscous zone and do not affect airflow the scales like any microstructures enlarge the problems of endopterygote insect wing functional morphology i 169 surface of contact between the air and wing and therefore probably prevent flow separation this does not however support the hypothetical role of the covering as a turbulizer although the influence of larger structures hairs and veins on the flow cannot be excluded generally speaking the survey of lepidopteran wing scale covering morphology reveals its lability in response to different functional demands this was illustrated by the adaptation of the covering to heat insulation to reducing wing inertia at the increase in stroke frequency and to the necessity of support of fore and hindwings coupling most evident are the previously described changes in the covering structure within different elements of color pattern characteristically almost all patternconditioned anomalies of the covering are observed within the distal half of the wing the region that does not participate in thermoregulation given these facts adaptations to the improvement of wing flight properties are at least not evident for example one could anticipate that scale orientation would coincide with the direction of airflow near the wing surface however comparison of morphologic data with information on flow around flapping wings sec 2426 does not reveal such a correlation therefore the assertion that scales do not interact with free airflow seems to be the least contradictory to currently known facts thus construction of the scale covering to a considerable degree is defined by the requirements of heat insulation and color pattern additional functions of scales can include aerodynamic but not in the sense of nachtigalls hypothesis autotomic scales permit moths to escape from spider webs and avoid entrapment in drops of plant resin and behavioral for example signaling in courtship ono 1977 1980 meanwhile no functional explanation exists for the origin of scales themselves scales are found on the wings and bodies of numerous insects besides lepidopterans including beetles curculionidae dipterous flies culicidae hymenopterans and caddisflies and they are even seen in the enthognatha collembola and thysanura lepismatidae machilidae shwanvich 1949 always as secondary structures scales do not form a continuous covering in all the previously mentioned taxa unlike in lepidopterans so their respective functions are unclear 49 conclusions the presented data and analyses demonstrate that modern knowledge on flapping flight aeromechanics chap 2 can quite effectively explain the initial radiation of existing types of flight apparatus and wingbeat kinematics 170 i form an nction of insect wings underlying the historical development of aerial locomotion of insects chap 3 furthermore thorough comparative analysis of wing morphology in endopterygotes chap 4 indicates a series of structural similarities of insect wings that cannot be explained by any similar functions fulfilled by these structures of course this situation can be ascribed to the lack of our knowledge of the functions of insect wings since we always can hope to learn tomorrow what we do not know today however this method of interpretation does not seem sufficiently reliable to me owing to the followingo circumstance we cannot anticipate that from a general biologic perspective the knowledge of adaptive functions however substantial it may be would provide us with an exhausting method of explanation of morphologic features found in living organisms every time an organism must change it possesses just a limited set of alternative developmental trajectories despite current demands of changing environment these types of limitations are called developmental constraints they are ubiquitous the influence of developmental constraints can be neglected only in studies of organisms that lack ontogeny per se they can be for example bacteria which must have a generally larger percent of adaptive traits however there are no reasons to predict the same outcome for insects and their wings developmental constraints originate from the selforganizing collective behavior of embryonic cells and from the interaction of different vestiges in the course of individual development the latter can be additionally illustrated by the perspective of development of the vertebrate limb presented by oster et al 1988 the limb skeleton develops through the condensation of mesenchymal cells that form cartilaginous vestiges of prospective digits only three types of cell condensation are possible focal condensation branching bifurcation and segmental bifurcation imagine that the conditions in which the limb operates were to favor trifurcation ie branching of one element into three or more parts leading to a more adaptively advantageous limb skeleton such morphology could not be realized since trifurcation is only possible under a very narrow set of developmental parameters and therefore is extremely unlikely oster et al 1988 however the organism would not inevitably reach extinction adaptation to external environment bears the character of adequacy gans 1993 organisms should be just sufficient in relation to the conditions in which they live whereas the concept of optimalitywhich has been repeatedly announced to be a reliable basis for problems of endopterygote insect wing functional morphology i 171 calculating morphologies from functionshas quite a limited number of successful applications see under optimality and adequacy in the appendix summarizing the given example we must admit that we do not have data indicating embryonic reasons for the development of particular homoplastic features of insect wings discussed in this chapter furthermore all available data on the causation of morphologic peculiarities of living beings indicate that to reliably derive morphologies directly from functions based on the concept of functional optimality of structures is impossible these considerations can be additionally supported speaking of animal morphology in general even the most widespread functional explanations of particular morphologic features are found to be untrue after considering comparative data for example we know that the melanic form of the birch inchworm moth received a strong selective advantage in comparison to gray specimens after the lichens growing on tree bark were killed by air pollution in nineteenthcentury england the advantage of the dark coloration was demonstrated in experiments in which birds easily found and ate gray moths on the dark bark deprived of lichens kettlewell1955 the selective basis for industrial melanism was considered to be proved and was subsequently incorporated into numerous textbooks on evolution however industrial melanism is also found in unpalatable insects eg ladybirds not connected in their life with tree bark and lichens moreover melanism can be observed even in cats krassilov 1986 evidently melanism results from a far more general reason than that reported for birch inchworm moths another example also ubiquitous in textbooks is given by the irish elk megaloceros the immensity of its antlers is usually attributed to a functional advantage under sexual selection specifically competition between males for females the winning males presumably had larger antlers which eventually became so large that they were strongly malfunctional in situations besides courtship behavior and finally caused extinction of the elk in fact megaloceros antler size closely fits the positive allometry of skeleton structures of all the family cervidae gould 1974 1977 which means that the antlers were this large simply because the elk itself was quite large the size increase in these animals could have resulted from an entirely different causesegregation in size owing to competition with related forms seems to be one of the most common methods of adaptive radiation within ecologically uniform groups for instance ungulates kokshaysky 1988a a third widespread example concerns the eyelike patterns on insect wings 172 i form an nction of insect wings their functional role in butterflies is usually interpreted as for deflecting bird attack a viewpoint corroborated by experimental data pianka 1978 however similar patterns are present on the wings of nocturnal saturniidae they were also found in the fossil neuropterans kalligrammatidae and psychopsidae rohdendorf and rasnitsyn 1980 which lived in the jurassic that is before the pronounced radiation of avian fauna that began in the cretaceous shimansky 1987 and in any case long before the origin of insecteating passerinae in general each of the presented examples found in the lower taxa is normally explained by particular functions found in separate groups but the explanation fails when we consider a broader pectrum of data on the morphology of neighboring groups consequently functional interpretations are falsified by homoplasies and leave the structural traits unexplained the last example demonstrates true reasons for similarities originating at the lower taxonomic levels avoiding the traditional functional interpretation it is a unique case combining a survey of comparative morphology physiology and embryology and dealing with the foot structure in neotropical salamanders the web between the digits of these animals is normally considered to be an adaptation to an arboreal mode of life it functions like a sticky vacuum sucker and provides definite advantages to salamanders that often walk on flat smooth wet leaves of tropical trees or on cave walls alberch 1981 wake 1991 nevertheless the web appears without any connection to life on vertical surfaces presence of the web correlates with fusion of the tarsal elements of the limb skeleton and it originates during individual development if the number of cells in the foot vestige falls below a particular threshold this can happen with a decrease in general body size alberch and gale 1985 oster et al 1988 wake 1991 which can be caused by various selective reasons although the functional importance of the web has been empirically and experimentally proven alberch 1981 this structure appears in evolution not as a reflection of the natural selection of climbing specimens but as one of the possible outcomes of ontogeny which are themselves determined by internal phenomena of the organism rather than external conditions of the environment thus webbed feet should be considered to be preadapted or protoadapted after gans 1974 for the life in trees and on walls used by some species but not for all salamanders that possess this structure alberch 1981 wake 1991 the case of the salamander foot web shows that concepts of homology and homoplasy can be extremely close and even overlap from one view problems of endopterygote insect wing functional lvjiphology i 173 point the web should be treated as a parallelism because it is absent in the ancestral form and appears independently in descendants owing to selection by another trait being a neutral feature itself moreover one cannot determine that the web is not homologous in different salamander species because identical developmental mechanisms occur in all species since they are inherited from the common ancestor moreover here we can see the difference between homology and homogeny because the webs of different species are homologous but not homogenous this example also provides evidence that the reasons for morphologic peculiarities observed in species and genera are caused by morphogenetic factors instead it is therefore unnecessary to continuously speculate on the functional significance of each structural feature of the lower taxa unless strong evidence supports such hypotheses summarizing this chapter the following evolutionary perspective can be depicted similar morphologic characters independently appear in different species owing to shared morphogenetic mechanisms initially organisms do not use these morphologic novelties since a coupled structurefunction cannot appear prior to the origin of both the structure and the function therefore any given structure originates as neutral relative to its future function ie as a protoadaptation according to gans 1988 while the function is initially fulfilled by other structures only after the association structurefunction has been established can natural selection obtain the opportunity to fit the structure to the function somehow changing the shape and size of the structure it can be suggested that exactly this happened to the corrugation of the costal vein secondary false veins covering scales and eyelike patterns on the wings of different insects after these structures had originated the first was adapted to protection of tracheae blood vessels and nerves in the wings of beetles the second to better reinforcement of dipterous fly wings the third to thermoinsulation in lepidopterans and the fourth to warning coloration meanwhile association between the structures and corresponding functions emerged only in some groups whereas the structures remained unexploited in other insect taxa characteristically the same feature can be used for different purposes in different groups for example the anal loop is supposed to facilitate coupling of the fore and hindwings in particular groups and to play the role of an adaptation to semiaquatic life in others whereas insects also exist that do not use this structure at all in general this situation accurately agrees with the general principles of animal functional and evolutionary morphology discussed in the appendix appendix form and function a review of general concepts what can lead to a way nothing but philosophy emperor marcus aurelius ad 121180 in this book i have attempted to show that some morphologic characters of insect wings can be interpreted as adaptations fulfilling certain functions by contrast there is a set of structural features that cannot be thought to be functionally significant future research might uncover adaptive reasons for the origin of these structures however this is not necessarily going to happen because the features unexplainable in functional terms often find their explanation in terms of morphogenetic processes this appendix can be used by those who are interested in further speculations on the subject how can we differentiate characters that do play functional roles from those that are just artifacts of ontogenetic reconstructions i will depart from the perspective of general functional morphology of organisms and try to show that functionally significant features generally characterize functional systems eg the wing apparatus as a whole whereas functionally neutral traits are mostly specific of single organs and their parts eg wing venation up to the present many explanations of biological form involve a purely selectionist approach most research papers describe new structures followed by hypotheses that suggest the way these structures could be used during the life of the organism however many biologists consider a minority of morphologic features to be adaptive mayr 1970 schmalhausen 1983 the remaining properties are thought to be byproducts of natural selection thus they are a priori left without any explanation meanwhile it seems necessary to try to find opportunities for complete explanations in organismal morphology 176 i appendr basic definitions general biology is replete with terms that possess several widespread noncoinciding interpretations discussion of the adaptive problem demands a preliminary definition of the main concepts a taxon is a group of organisms that is distinct enough to be given a name mayr 1970 liubarsky 1993 evolution is defined as the process of transformation of taxa dullemeijer 1980 or as a change in morphofunctional organization margalef 1992 or as an inherited change of trajectory of normal ontogeny shishkin 1988 or as the control of development by ecology van valen 1974 hence evolution consists in an inherited change of normal ontogeny of an organism and that evolution leads to taxonomically significant reconstruction of the morphofunctional organization resulting in a novel appearance relative to the preceding history of the organism adaptedness is the ability of an organism to extract from the environment an amount of energy sufficient to maintain vital activity bock and von wahlert 1965 a structure is a spatial configuration assessed by the sense organs primarily the eyes lima de faria 1988 structures can be reliably recognized among the other structures of an organism vedenov et al 1972 and involve systems of organs and organs and their parts organs are more or less isolated parts of an organism schmalhausen 1938 to some extent separate and relatively independent liubarsky 1991b a function is an aspect of the interaction between the parts of an organism and between organisms and their environment vorobjova and meyen 1988 this is perhaps its most general definition in other words a function is a flow of energy between structures lima de faria 1988 hence function is often considered to be a change of the condition of a structure bock and von wahlert 1965 bliakher 1976 dullemeijer 1980 wainwright 1988 lauder 1990 iordansky 1994 by comparison the definition of function as adaptation is more specific function is the expedient reaction of living organisms having an adaptive significance in interactions of the organisms with their environment matveev 1945 1957 kaganova 1972 as kokshaysky 1980 stated this is a definition of function at the organismallevel this particular interpretation of function is used subsequently structures are objects under study in morphology chebanov 1984 and functions are topics in physiology sensu lato schmidtnielsen 1979 ugolev 1985 form ancrfunction i 177 following severtzov 1939 functions may be active and passive hence structures can function actively and passively a passive function involves changes in the condition of a structure resulting from the action of an external related to the structure force an active function involves force generated within the structure activity and passivity depend on the level of consideration for example the strokes of flying insects involve a passive function of wings and an active function of the pterothorax on the molecular level all functions are passive on the organismal level functions are mostly active however passive functions are also quite widespread eg dispersal with wind and stream warming in sunshine perception of external signals etc functions and structures are described by features also called characters or traits features are fragments of organization delineated and named for a definite purpose liubarsky 1994 bock and von wahlert 1965 any property that demonstrates a similarity or difference in organisms their parts or groups rasnitsyn and dlussky 1988 a digit of morphologic or physiologic discretion of an organism lobashev 1963 faculties after bock and von wahlert 1965 are pairs of features incorporating morphologic and physiologic aspects of organization for instance wing flight or eye vision faculties are idealized results of morphofunctional analysis and hence elementary objects in functional morphology faculties can be adaptive neutral or antiadaptive if the latter they reduce the difference between the normal in comparison to related species deprived of this faculty and necessary amount of consumed energy thus they diminish the probability that the organism will be preserved in future generations an archetype is an abstract model reflecting the construction of all the diverse forms included in a given group bliakher 1976 kouzin 1987 it is a generalized plan of organismal design within a given taxon chaikovsky 1994 in other words an archetype is a schematic diagram a definite sum of connections between elements of the system svidersky 1962 elements are presented by structures in the morphologic archetype this particular definition has been undermined by classic morphology under the term archetype after owen and by functions in the physiologic archetype vorobjova and meyen 1988 nevertheless recognition of archetypes is a task for comparative functional morphology because this procedure involves determination of interrelation and interdependence ie functions of parts of an organism accordingly liubarsky 1993 called the knowledge of functions a glue for morphology 178 i appendit archetypes are the central and most complicated concept of comparative morphology and have numerous conflicting interpretations often they are understood as ancestral morphology this is an inadmissibly concrete definition a generalized ancestor can occupy even a more distant position from the archetype than recent groups each having found its own way of deciphering the schematic diagram each having understood and developed the main idea of the scheme in a particular way an ancestor has just entered the adaptive zone of the taxon it is not abundant and fits the new environment poorly because its parts are not yet well coadapted to fulfill the peculiar functions demanded by the new conditions of life evolving descendants must form a new adaptive zone using primary opportunities to greater or lesser extent and adjusting interactions functions between particular structures thus an archetype a generalized morphologic description of a taxon arises in parallel with an adaptive zone a generalized ecologic description of the taxon and is not something given in advance an original concept for understanding the archetype was suggested by beloussov 1980 he concentrated on the fact that the ontogeny of different classes of vertebrates shows not only divergence but initially shows convergence of individual development towards a knot of similarity which in the vertebrata is presented by the stage of axial organs that has the same morphology in all the classes accordingly beloussov stated that owens archetype of a taxon should be depicted not as an adult form but as an embryonic stage corresponding to the knot of similarity of the taxon blocks of the schematic diagram are called merones after the greek wpocr part meyen 1978 shreider 1983 chaikovsky 1990 liubarsky 1993 each merone has its own name correspondence of parts of real organisms to merones of the archetype constitutes owens general homology thus the procedure of homologization does not demand recognition of a common ancestor nevertheless once the ancestor has been recognized its parts can be brought into agreement with the archetype that is homologized in a general sense having been homologized the parts of the ancestral organism can be named owens concept of special homology or lankesters homogeny is applicable to structures found in different organisms if these organisms can be thought of as descending from a common ancestor and whenever these structures correspond to the same part of the ancestors body different structures in different beings recent andjor extinct adult andor embryo are treated as homologous if they are characterized by similar location andjor form and function i 179 table al correlation of concepts designating different types of secondary similarity in organisms homoplasies in homologous structures in nonhomologous structures adaptive nonadaptive homoiology convergence parallelism isomorphism construction many andjors are because any of the criteria can be violated a situation is imaginable that meets no single criterion since evolution changes the construction of parts their allocation inside the organism the way of generation in ontogeny and other special details however merones generally remain recognizable special homology is a completely secondary concept in relation to general homology because in actual practice the ancestor is recognized by its similarity to the archetype which has already been derived based on comparative study of descendants the morphospace of a taxon is the sum or betterintegral of the archetypes of all the subordinate taxa it can be described as a hypervolume in hyperspace of features of the merones of all the organisms included in the taxon meyen 1978a unity of features embracing all the diversity of the taxon chaikovsky 1994 see also liubarsky 1991a two or more different organisms are called similar if they share common features characters of primary similarity are inherited from common ancestors and are synonymous for homogeny or special homology characters of secondary similarity which are absent in the nearest common ancestor and originate later being independent in distinct pathways of evolution are called homoplasies russell 1916 futuyma 1986 sanderson and donoghue 1989 wake 1991 rasnitsyn 1986 1992a beklemishev 1994 as we have already seen primary and secondary similarities are not strictly distinguishable concepts see sec 49 it is also impossible to state a strict distinction between different types of secondary similarity however homoplasies can be conventionally distributed among four categories tab a1 parallelism constitutes nonadaptive secondary similarity of homologous parts timofeeffressovsky et al 1977 severtzov 1990 if organisms share a sufficient number of merones they are placed in related taxa if parallelisms are observed simultaneously in several merones parallel evolution of the taxa must be taking place bigelow 1958 schmalhausen 1969 raup and stanley 1971 meyen 1973 berg 1977 menner and makridin 1988 jordansky 1994 180 i appendix convergence or analogy after aristotle is often observed in equivalent environments it constitutes adaptive homoplasy of nonhomologous structures different merones are obtained by nonrelated beings hence convergence is thought to be an attribute of the evolution of phyla that diverged long ago darwin 1872 schmalhausen 1969 1983 bliakher 1976 pianka 1978 mednikov 1980 simpson 1980 vorobjova 1980 dogel 1981 severtzov 1987 menner and makridin 1988 iordansky 1994 homoiology after plate constitutes adaptive homoplasy of homologous organs say the parietal crest in gorillas and hyenas or the breastbone in birds and moles bliakher 1976 a logical possibility for the fourth category exists namely nonadaptive secondary similarity of nonhomologous parts such similarity has been described in plants for flowers and inflorescences meyen 1974 examples are not numerous this can be a temporal situation owing to low anticipation on the basis of uptodate biologic concepts and have no special term they might be designated as isomorphisms bliakher 1976 presumably isomorphisms are caused by developmental patterns that have not been inherited from a common ancestor but are at the same time similar this can be anticipated when developmental processes are comparatively simple and based on a small number of logical opportunities so that secondary similarity is acquired regularly but in fact on a random basis owing to purely probabilistic reasons and without a common factor such as similar demands of environment complementarity of formgenerating factors and uncertainty of explanations in morphology recognition of the problem modern biology states that the evolution of an organismal morphology is simultaneously influenced by two factors natural selection external in reference to the organism and embryonic processes that determine allocation of differentiated tissues in ontogeny internal factor both factors only partially depend on previous evolution of the organism see further explanations below the action of natural selection is evident from observation of analogies which are convergent features acquired by beings of different organization under adaptation to similar environmental conditions canonical examples of analogies include the streamlined body shape of large fastswimming ver form andfunction i 181 tebrates the robust extremities in digging animals the characteristic profile of wings fins and flippers thickness always decreasing from the leading to the trailing edge and the sphericity of some species of cactaceae and euphorbiaceae rigorously stated evolutionary convergence does not strictly demand possession of one particular function if quite different functions exploit a common physical principle that is enough stated by g b kofman personal communication a priori the number of such principles and of organic constructions built around them is not large and nature may not be able to use them all so a particular task that natural selection imposes on a changing organism can be resolved in a limited number of ways this explains a long range of convergences in functional systems in very different organisms animal wings and flying seeds of plants ennos 1989d eyes in vertebrate and invertebrate animals alexander 1988 thermal insulating coverings in mammals birds and insects swim bladders in aquatic animals and plants acoustic and vocalization organs in diverse animals the most general reason for the origin of convergent similarity seems to be minimization of substance and energy cost regular shape is explained by economy of material mordukhajboltovskoj 1936 hence as only few symmetry types exist in threedimensional space organisms resulting from the selection for the minimal amount of necessary matter inevitably fall into several groups of similarity defined by their type of symmetry the same can be said about forms such as the hexagonal facets in insect compound eyes honeycombs or epithelial cells these shapes evolve because hexagons are geometrical figures that fill surfaces with the least perimeter of cell walls in a similar way icosahedrons are regular ridge polytopes characterized by minimal surface area for a given volume this determines the morphology of some viruses and radiolaria also minimization of surface area to body volume ratio leads to sphericity irrespective of the role this minimum plays in the life of the organism examples include the deceleration of evaporation in arid zone plants the decrease in the probability of meeting enemies in colonial protozoans diminishing heat loss or something else exploitation of common physical principles explains not only analogies in organismal construction but also those in inert and ideal objects stevens 1973 petukhov 1981 vasiutinsky 1990 zimov 1993 the influence of morphogenetic factors is primarily observable in the parallel evolution of related forms the best elaborated examples are given by 182 i appendix the secondary similarity of anuran legs alberch 1981 alberch and gale 1985 oster et al 1988 wake 1991 and shells of cerion gould 1984 1989 in general it can be considered to be proved that morphologic variability is not accidental but instead results from the action of particular morphogenetic mechanisms which are able to create only a limited number of patterns evidence is given by vast data of comparative embryology and teratology krenke 1927 seilacher 1974 beloussov 1975 lande 1978 maynard smith 1978 alberch 1980 gould 1984 1989 oster et al 1988 belintsev 1991 saveljev 1993 related species share common morphogenetic mechanisms each mechanism can produce only a limited range of morphologic variants of a structure as a result organisms generally are able to engender only a restricted spectrum of different descendants the latter is expressed in the phenomenon of epigenetic landscapes waddington 1940 the more related two taxa are the more complete is the coincidence of their morphologic diversity vavilov 1968 practically speaking vavilovs homologous series in the variability of several taxa suggest that those taxa possess common developmental mechanisms of pattern formation thus they are related a range of modalities of a particular feature occurring in many species defines together with the mechanism of their generation a feature of a high taxon genus or family the latter consideration is used in reconstructions of phylogenies chernykh 1986 if an organism and the processes of its formation are simple enough comprising a comparatively narrow range of logical opportunities for construction of each structure purely probabilistic reasons suggest that homoplasies will appear regularly in quite distant groups families and orders this is more apparent and common in plants than in animals see the long list of examples given by went 1971 and meyen 1973 bacteria also display secondary similarity owing to their simple morphology this imposes strong handicaps for phylogenetic reconstructions zavarzin 1969 1974 morphogenetic factors are independent of natural selection within evolutionary sequences the range of forms an organism can engender is totally determined by its epigenetic landscape and preexists in reference to the beginning of an elementary evolutionary change based on this consideration the structuralist paradigm suggests a triple approach to the explanation of biologic form using physiological morphogenetic and historical arguments fig ala seilacher 1974 thomas 1978 1979 from my viewpoint the historical factor adds unnecessary complication in this scheme it would be simpler and quite adequate to include time in the morphofunctional system form amifunction a historical factor phylogeny b ontogeny adaptation functional factor adaptation i 183 morphogenetical factor ontogeny phylogeny 1 figure a1 general approaches to the explanation of form in organisms a structuralist approach b approach suggested hereinafter since history reflects the collaborative action of previous morphogenetic and selective reasons fig ai b mutual independence of the two patternforming factors leads to the necessity of bringing to biology bohrs concept of complementarity according to which biologic structures have a dual nature bohr himself repeatedly wrote about the ubiquity of typical complementarity in biology bohr 1971 pp 398 490 524 this suggestion was later supported by numerous authors meyen 19731974 1975 korochkin 1986 gould 1984 1992 arnold et al 1989 chaikovsky 1990 1994 belintsev 1991 berg 1993 roth et al 1993 thomas and reif 1993 vakhrushev and rautian 1993 kouchrov 1995 nowadays it is unclear liubarsky 1993 whether the classic interpretation of bohrs term as it is used in quantum mechanics can be used in biology physical science deals with micro world phenomena which have nothing in common with things in the macro world and thus cannot be described in equivalent terms heisenberg 1969 otherwise complementarity in physics means neither this nor that whereas in biology both this and that in any case the need for this concept arises in studying phenomena that appear in two distinct contexts whenever there exists a specialized language for description of each aspect but the languages are not mutually translatable g b kofman personal communication similar in korochkin 1986 the concept of complementarity indeed admits that two factors are acting and that we do not know how to combine them within a single framework nor how to reduce the biologic complexity into simple mutually correlated and at the same time adequate terms complementarity is kept in use until a special language has 184 i appendia been elaborated for description of the phenomenon under study a similar situation exists also in psychology history economics and other sciences which scriven 1959 called irregular subjects based on the complementarity concept biologic diversity at first approximation should be considered as an intersection of two sets forms able to appear and forms able to survive resulting in the subset of forms that have appeared and survived raup and michelson 1965 seilacher 1974 thomas 1979 gould 1984 1989 thomas and rei 1993 both sets are a priori much larger than the intersection on the one hand the widest opportunities of pattern formation in any species are evident from the vast number of races and breeds of domestic animals and cultivated plants the external difference among which is much larger than that among wild species on the other hand wheels and propellers represent highly effective locomotor organs but no such systems occur in organisms as a consequence a complete explanation of organic form neither can be purely morphological after geoffroy nor can it be based on the sole knowledge of functions after cuvier mutual redundancy and independence of the sets have engendered the concept of constraint which is the source of restrictions on change that do not arise through the action of stated causes within a taken theoretic frame gould 1989 as a result each of the two patterngenerating factors obtains its own scope of competence with specific rules for deduction in fact necessity is determined by one group of rules and opportunity by another the two scopes are divided by space which is impenetrable for logics therefore in theoretical morphology like in quantum mechanics the dual nature of structures and complementarity of factors results in uncertainty of any deduced statement an imaginable deterministic prognosis can be built around either selective or morphogenetic considerations and there are no rules for logical transition between the two groups of phenomena which are totally random in relation to each other uncertainty represents the main theoretical problem treated in this part of the book i will try to show that the features of an organism can be approximately divided into two categories one owing to natural selection and the other mainly to morphogenetic regularities the following account demands consideration of two basic concepts of functional morphology which seem to need no special corroboration and have no exceptions in relation to the description of living organisms these basic concepts are hierarchy of faculties and multivariate correspondence form and diction i 185 a hierarchy consequences stabilization of functions unavoidable morphospace stabilization filling up of structures b multivariate correspondence c consequences functions structures adaptive tradeoff suboptimality compensation changeability figure a2 the correspondence between main general concepts of evolutionary and functional morphology for terms and explanations see text between structures and functions fig a2 consequences derived from principles are not corollaries in the mathematical sense owing to ubiquitous complementarity hardly a statement in biology univalently follows a more general concept in biology consequence is a notion based on a commonly accepted idea but usually with an additional meaning in relation to the idea hierarchy of faculties a hierarchy is a series in which each member is included in the member that precedes it and includes all those members that follow it medawar and medawar 1983 hiearchy is an aspect of biologic complexity which was broadly discussed in connection with the concept of structural and functional levels in living systems bykhovskii et al 1972 timofeeffressovsky et al 1977 riedl1977 186 i appendix figure a3 distal parts of the wings of the squacco heron ardeola ralloides a and of the common heron ardea cinerea b after kokshaysky 1988a 1988b the principle of evolutionary stabilization of functions all structures and functions of organisms are constructed hierarchically fig a2a this is directly connected with the principle of evolutionary stabilization of functions proposed by kokshaysky 1973 1980 1988a 1988b according to this principle and to accommodate changed conditions minor alterations are made in peripheral details of the corresponding formfunction complex with minimum change of the function itself this also occurs in a more general formulation during evolution any system retains systemic similarity at the expense of deflections from geometric and other particular types of similarity sahal1976 kokshaysky illustrated the principle of evolutionary stabilization with several cases of the dependence of morphology on the absolute size of specimens two cases are presented subsequently the first example deals with wings and flight in herons an ecologically uniform family of birds the planform and flight kinematics of wings are similar in all heron species the only difference being that the speciesspecific number of slots between marginal feathers constantly increases with body size fig a3 slots manage the angle of attack and prevent separation of airflow for this concept see sec 22 from the wing edge because this separation becomes more dangerous with the increased size of the bird the general interpretation of this simple fact is that in the size range of herons an increase in absolute size is accompanied by small but regular violations of geometric and dynamic similarity in the distal zone of the wings form and function i 187 in the long run these minor alterations favor preservation of geometric dynamic and physiologic aspects of similarity of flight in this family in other words the described regularity assures that herons of different size the biggest are more than twelvefold the weight of the smallest share general features of the structure biomechanics and physiology of their flight system keeping a constant ecologic similarity or adaptive zone within the family other bird families overcome the difficulty raised by the increase in total mass in different ways one way involves intensification of flight accompanied by narrowing and for shortening of the wings more frequent wing beats greater velocity and smaller angles of attack however this would change the appearance and ecologic niche typifying herons into one typical of ibises an opposite possibility consists in reducing the angle of attack widening and inactivating the wings and adopting the soaring flight typical of storks only the emargination of the wingtip feathers enables large herons to keep a heron morphology and to continue to occupy the ecologic niche characteristic of this family involving hunting in wait for prey and assessment of feeding territories from aloft kokshaysky 1988a 1988b kokshayskys second example considers the scaling of locomotion of quadrupedal mammals galileo was the first to notice that as animals increase in size they must have an allometrically more robust skeleton to resist gravity the proportions found in nature have been explained using the concept of elastic similarity a hypothesis corroborated by data on limb bones of adult ungulates with excellent agreement between data and theoretical model mcmahon 1973 1975 nevertheless a consideration of material on a wider range of mammals from seven different orders showed the preservation of simple geometric similarity alexander et al 1979 this is unclear from the traditional viewpoint especially since the bones of small and large mammals possess identical strength and tension indices biewener 1982 1983 the entire range of mammals could display a mechanism that overcomes the increase of locomotory loads on bones and this mechanism could be dynamic rather than static indeed along with the size increase in mammals their legs become progressively straightened fig a4 this reduces the moment of the force resulting from interaction with the ground so what is stabilized in the second example perhaps in the ungulate case this is the groupspecific type of locomotion associated with peculiar skeletal construction and arrangement of muscles elongated distal elements of legs leg operating as a simple lever moving only back and forth the stabilization allows general kinds of similarity including ecology and bene 188 i appendix figure a4 the tendency to straighten limbs in supporting phase of quadrupedal locomotion in mammals under an increase in size after gambarian 1972 from kokshaysky 1988a 1988b fits from the elastic similarity ungulates form a morphologically and ecologically uniform group of animals so differentiation in size is an important mechanism of their diversification furthermore the choice of methods usable by larger animals for resisting gravity is restricted extreme changes in functional morphology can make the species lose adequacy to the adaptive zone hence a passive increase in bone thickness is practically the only possible way in which ungulates can resist increased loading quadrupedal mammals do not maintain a particular locomotory type but rather the very opportunity to run this is permitted through a huge range of mass values at the expense of abrupt changes in morphology and biomechanics the general geometric similarity of mammals is quite evident and documents the disadvantages of extra thickening or thinning of the bones kokshaysky 1988a 1988b form alunction i 189 in general treatment of data on massdependence of different morphofunctional characteristics by regression analysis requires the consideration that the initial data can be approximated to a line that describes the common tendency in the entire group at the same time particular clouds of dots also exist that are characterized by local regression lines to mass these subordinate lines indicate morphologic functional and ecologic peculiarities of subordinate taxa particular and general lines can be quite distinct and have different slopes first described by kokshaysky 1970 these subsets were later explored in greater detail as reviewed by schmidtnielsen 1984 who designated them as secondary signals examples have been adduced for massspecific data on the metabolic rate in mammals circadian energy budget and egg weight in birds another example of an adaptive radiation pattern that matches kokshayskys theory well is cranial construction in amphisbaenians gans 1974 amphisbaenians comprise a sister group to lizards or lizards snakes and occupy a subterranean mode of life burrowing through the soil with the help of their cranially reinforced heads this burrowing function is displayed in several modifications and the skulls of the amphisbaenians adapted to each modification differ so markedly fig as that it is very difficult to believe that these animals are related nevertheless all these profound changes affect only the visceral part of the skull whereas the cerebral braincontaining section remains equivalent in all species independent of the mode of burrowing used kokshayskys ideas are strongly supported by the extensive material developed by shwartz and his followers shwartz et al 1968a 1968b shwartz 1980 representing the sverdlovsk ekaterinburg school of russiansoviet ecologists that began in the 1950s their results seem to be unique in the world literature they investigated adaptations to extreme environments at the levels of species and populations shwartzs work showed that whenever related species inhabit contrasting environments northsouth lowlandmountains they do not differ significantly in the major morphofunctional characteristics relative weights of brain heart lungs liver pancreas bowels and kidneys and hemoglobin concentration however different populations of particular species inhabiting an equivalent range with similar contrasting conditions differed greatly in these indices for example the montane populations of a normal lowland species were characterized by increased heart volume whereas nearby but typically montane species had hearts of the usual size this result seemed paradoxical since populations exhibited obvi 190 i appendzx figure as skull shapes in amphisbaenians a amphisbaena bakeri b ancylocranium ionidesi c monopeltis jugularis after gans 1974 a b c ous adaptations to extreme environments whereas species did not nevertheless the result was corroborated by outstanding data for several hundred species including all major groups of terrestrial tetrapods shwartz suggested that changes in organs functionally connected with diverse features of the organism are unlikely to be energetically advantageous because such changes disturb a historically achieved morphofunctional coordination according to shwartz macromorphologic deviations are less effective than those at the level of molecules cells and tissues ie changes at lower levels of organization for instance by different variants of enzymes structural proteins and intracell ionic media these changes tend to result in tissue incompatibility and thus in reproductive isolation which is therefore the consequence of speciation rather than a cause consequently new species will differ in minor features rather than in the features of the generic archetype the latter can be violated and changed in the beginning of an evolutionary change but it is thereafter rebuilt under the formgenerating influence of stabilizing natural selection the arguments of kokshaysky and shwartz differ mainly on the rank form and function i 191 of considered taxa thus shwartz discusses adaptations in populations and species whereas kokshaysky examines families and orders several similar examples are known labarbera 1990 nikolajchuk et al 1991 with practically identical conclusions in all cases the generation of a new taxon commonly leaves the main features of organization archetype of the upper rank unchanged adaptation to a new environment commonly involves change of parts that are less important for the organism as a whole another formulation the principle of minimum change in all likelihood the principle of evolutionary stabilization of functions results from the elements of high hierarchical levels interacting with a larger number of other parts of the organism correspondingly the higher the level of morphofunctional change the more exclusive the reconstruction of the organism meanwhile evolution proceeds by a path along which the total sum of changes is minimal evolution follows the least change of organization hence evolution is directed at least on intervals between bifurcations earlier in this century rashevsky 1943a 1943b 1954 1965 introduced the principle of maximal simplicity in organismal morphology he stated that a particular structure or a construction found in nature is the simplest among possible structures and constructions able to fulffil a given function however this principle can hardly be used in this form for verification it needs formalization and illustration with particular biologic examples nevertheless it is unclear how to define the maximum value of simplicity by contrast usage of the principle of least change submits the problem to mathematic investigation instead of determining the absolute simplicity of a construction only the magnitude of its change relative to the previous condition must be measured this is much simpler to do because describing a complex figure is a much more difficult and almost impossible task than comparing two complex figures darcy thompson 1942 in fact kokshaysky provided a biologic reformulation of the maupertuis 16981759 physical principle of least action the higher the level under consideration the less likely the changes to it structures and functions tend to be very conservative instead mayr 1970 lauder 1990 vorobjova 1991 such stability does not mean absence of variation but instead just the opposite variability is the basis of each new clade but it is given a direction from previously existing structure schmalhausen 1945 since the type rules all its varied modifications russell1916 192 i appena the principle of stabilization of functions used in evolutionary physiology is the parallel of the principle of evolutionary stabilization of structures or the unity of type in morphology both rules together indicate action of the principle of the minimal change on functions and structures correspondingly this explains the generally inert nature of evolution the idea shows why the number of taxa decreases with the growth of rank that is why new classes originate more rarely than new species unavoidable filling of morphospace the principle of minimum change has the consequence that corresponds to the course and rate of evolution a taxon will not become another taxon until all the constructions permitted by the morphology of the lower taxa have appeared and been tested by natural selection mamkaev 1983 1984 seems to have been the first to suggest a similar statement namely that any system of an organism can appear in a restricted number of morphofunctional variants and that all these variants will appear in evolution an illustration of this statement constitutes the pattern of evolutionary diversification of the main types of insect flight kinematics provided in chapter 3 another example is given by the evolution of the projectile tongue in salamanders see references in wake 1996 for the tongue projection skeleton modification is necessary only two arrangements of skeletal elements are possible and they both have been used within different lineages of salamanders giving the same functional result the principle of the necessary filling of morphospace is analogous to the movement of liquid over a surface the farthest edge of the flow only progresses after any cavity it meets on its way has been filled such a sequence of events can be compared to the main trends in evolution which were proposed by severtzov in his classic survey on evolutionary animal morphology severtzov 1939 fig a6 his scheme includes two main directions called arogenesis and allogenesis the first involves the progressive change of an organism making it more complex more differentiated and thereby able to survive under a broader range of environmental conditions the morphofunctional result of arogenic evolution is acquisition of a set of novel features enabling the organisms to enter a new adaptive zone this set has been named aromorphosis in russian literature after severtzov 1939 in the west a more common term is adaptive syndrome gans 1974 simple examples of adaptive character sets are given by differentiation of blood circulation into two cir form anei function i 193 time figure a6 the scheme of macroevolutionary events after severtzov 1939 circles correspond to species planes to higher taxa meyens archetypes or potential morphospaces severtzov recognized three main types of morphologic change arcgenesis a idioadaptation i or allogenesis and regress r the latter can be thought of as a type of allogenesis because any adaptation to a particular narrow environment is followed by simplification of organismal construction see text to combine the concepts of severtzovs idioadaptation and regress only inclination of the scheme is necessary as in the fragment fitting well the neodarwinian paradigm this scheme shows only divergent processes while convergence is at least as common an evolutionary phenomenon berg 1977 cuits in terrestrial tetrapods segregation of the digestive system in mammals and insects endothermy and differentiation of brain and sense organs the origin of insect flight and correspondingly the origin of pterygote insects comprising the absolute majority of species is a typical case of a novel adaptive syndrome allogenesis is the adaptation of an organism to a particular environment through acquisition of minor morphofunctional peculiarities moreover aro 194 i appendit genesis and allogenesis are changes on correspondingly high and low levels of organization thus owing to the principle of the necessary filling of morphospace evolution continues its allogenic ways until all the principally permitted states are tested only then will a new adaptive syndrome evolve and many organismal features change for example acquisition of feathers by bird ancestors permitted the evolution of complex thermoregulatory mechanisms and enabled flapping flight which caused aspects such as pneumatization of bones differentiation of feathers differential increase in muscle mass typical breastbone and air sacs shortening and fusion of caudal vertebrae complex brain and behavior repertoires including navigation weakened sense of smell and strong vision and hearing rautian 1988 appearance of a new type of biologic organization will inevitably cause eventual reconstruction of ecosystems and hence subsequent evolution of organisms that inhabited those ecosystems earlier therefore emergence of a new level of organismic complexity is followed by numerous changes at lower organizational levels as a result the phylogenetic tree remains dynamic on the geologic scale taxa constantly appear disappear and reemerge like the branches of a tree that constantly grow longer emerge and disappear with the caveat that thicker branches are more stable and will not reemerge once they have disappeared the principle of the unavoidable filling of morphospace illustrates why groups that undergo evolutionary morphologic simplification are more numerous than those that are selected for increased complexity reductional mutations are very abundant serebrovsky 1973 schmalhausen 1983 andreduction can be more simple morphogenetically whenever the structure to be reduced lies on the periphery of embryonic organizers for this concept see waddington 1940 saxen and toivonen 1962 gans 1974 and beloussov 1987 accordingly ecologic specialization tends to be followed by relative simplification of the construction in taxonomic analysis features describing reduced organs are lighter and less important than progressive more complex changes liubarsky 1991b the necessity or relative feasibility of using all available constructions permits a group to decelerate a generally progressive succession of evolutionary changes this is evident on the geologic scale and has been depicted in severtzovs 1939 scheme fig a6 the principle of necessity shows the perspective of evolutionary prognoses that is our ability to more or less definitely foresee in what manner organisms are going to change after another significant change of environ form and function i 195 ment the latter can be a result eg of human impact on the biosphere the main problem that must be resolved is a procedure for the analysis of morphospace in severtzovs scheme this is symbolized by a plane and acts as the cavity on the way of evolutionary change an essential property of the morphospace of a mature taxon is that it is structured any morphospace performs a particular set of morphologic conditions this is caused by the interaction of two facts first any feature varies within definite limits hence all species of a taxon are likely to lie within a limited volume of ndimensional space second taxon evolution is inevitably followed by adaptive radiation branching of phyletic lines which is connected with specialization of subtaxa in the use of specific kinds of resources whereas the forms intermediate between specialized subtaxa become extinct giller 1984 chernykh 1986 iordansky 1994 rasnitsyn 1996 in other words maturation of a taxon is the process of splitting the primary continuous opportunity space into a number of nonoverlapping cells however divergence of subtaxa and partitioning of an environment formation of new cells cannot proceed infinitely since the resources in any ecosystem are limited furthermore the number of specimens comprising a viable population cannot fall below a certain value soule 1987 and supporting vital activity of the minimum number of specimens demands energy consequently each cell of an environment must be able to supply its inhabitant population with at least a minimum of energy this corresponds to the early idea by timofeeffressovsky 1995 that morphologic diversity can be described as a set of quanta or units further indivisible at the acquired level of taxonomic analysis several previous descriptions of the space of morphologic opportunities deal with rather simple shapes mollusk shells raup and michelson 1965 raup 1966 1967 bacteria zavarzin 1974 and hydroid polyps beloussov 1975 more complicated cases are considerably more problematic gould 1984 thomas and reif 1993 for example a profound survey of butterfly color patterns conducted by nijhout 1991 showed that morphospace is limited by more than three variables thus its representation is quite sophisticated and can be carried out at a generic level rather than a higher one above all raup and coworkers documented potential and real morphospaces the second is a part of the first as an evidence for the fact that not all ontogenypermitted constructions are adaptive raup and stanley 1971 nijhout 1991 developed these ideas further having pointed out nondirect correspondence between developmental space and morphospace more than one point of 196 i appendix developmental space can correspond to a point in morphospace but morphospace also contains points that have no prototypes in developmental space such morphologic conditions would be prohibited ontogenetically because they cannot be achieved by means of any adjustment of developmental parameters a general procedure for morphospace quantification was proposed by meyen 1973 1974 1990 as the concept of repeated polymorphic sets rpss each rps constitutes a series of morphologic states modalities according to rasnitsyn and dlussky 1988 of a given merone chebanov 1977 1984 chaikovsky 1990 the principal property of a rps is its recurrence any member of an rps can be derived of a neighboring modality by a transformation that is the same for all the series to be exact an rps is darcy thompsons 1942 transformation trajectory divided into standard or similar in mathematical sense segments meyens concept promises so much to theoretical biology that the most surprising aspect of the recurrent polymorphic sets is that they do indeed exist their reality was first shown by krenke 1927 in his outstanding work on the shape of plant leaves in addition to the particular rps given by meyen and krenke in their cited articles data on leaf segmentation morphology of spores and pollen epidermal structures vein anastomoses and plant teratologies several analogous examples developed from the famous publication by hutchinson 1959 reviewed by maiorana 1978 and giller 1984 sympatric species of a genus form a series with their body and for mouthpart size with neighbors differing by a factor of 128 these examples illustrate the result of competition in splitting initially undivided morphospace representing a single genus into cells corresponding to species likewise each of hutchinsons series is characterized by a specific kind of similarity and the process of speciation that led to the origin of recurrent series is evidently analogous to that given by the examples of kokshaysky 1988a 1988b as with all regularities in biology the hutchinsonmeyen rule has its exceptions nonetheless it illustrates well opportunities to calculate morphospace and shows perspectives of predictive biology in any case any science starts from what is present but sooner or later begins to consider things that are not evident but that could also exist kolmogorov 1991 form and function i 197 multivariate correspondence between structures and functions correspondence between morphologic and functional archetypes is incomplete vorobjova and meyen 1988 because form and function are not directly connected iljichev 1973 malakhov 1980 this conclusion was given concrete expression by maslov 1980 1984 who put forward the principle of multivariate correspondence between structures and functions any organ fulfills more than one function and each function is supported by multiple morphologic structures fig a2 b this phenomenon was also discussed by severtzov 1939 kokshaysky 1980 and fabri 1980 superposition of hierarchical fig a2 a and multivariate fig a2 b schemes gives the schematic diagram of biologic organization within this diagram one can model different rules of structural and functional evolution for examples see dohrn 1875 russell 1916 and plate 1928 these rules were first systematized by severtzov 1939 and intensively discussed and strongly supplemented after his basic survey matveev 1945 1957 vorontzov 1961 1967 1989 arshavsky 1968 kokshaysky 1980 1988a 1988b shwartz 1980 matienko 1981 schmidtnielsen 1984 ugolev 1985 alexander 1988 natochin 1988a 1988b mamkaev 1991 swartz and biewener 1992 tystchenko 1992 thomas and reif 1993 following severtzov 1939 these rules however should be considered as particular cases of evolution rather than stable general biologic regularities because a single evolutionary change of organism can be accompanied by nearly all kinds of structural and functional change simultaneously the principle of multivariate correspondence has two consequences which are of fundamental importance for functional morphology consequence 1 adaptive tradeoff organismal construction fits the principle of adaptive tradeoff norris and lowe 1964 gans 1983 1988 rasnitsyn 1984 1987 dudley and gans 1991 each structure functions in a manner that does not interfere with the functioning of other parts of an organism consequently all structures tend to be more or less functionally suboptimal because each function establishes its own conditions on the construction of an organism because conflicting functions waste energy natural selection acts to decrease energy expenditure of the organism and to achieve a compromise among all functions ac 198 i appendix cordingly the organism as a whole set of faculties corresponds to one of the local minima of the space of constructional opportunities in other words the overall organism but not its parts is locally optimal the principle of adaptive tradeoff has its own consequences fig a2b first any change of organismal construction can be achieved only via an inadaptive state inadaptation is a onesided change of few features not followed by corresponding changes in the general construction of the organism rasnitsyn 1986 thus inadapted beings are characterized by a broken tradeoff condition are evolutionarily nonstable and are normally displaced from their niche by more adaptive euadaptive forms that can persist for long periods of time owing to their betterbalanced tradeoff construction paraphrasing the wellknown saying by churchill tradeoff is awkward but everything else is worse because of this tradeoff evolution is not monotone transition among relatively stable states proceeds via instable states which correspond to inadaptive phases of the evolutionary cycle rasnitsyn 1986 kreslavsky 1991 we may therefore assume that evolution is possible only in ecologically soft conditions lacking strong pressure from predators and competitors that is when ecosystems are not saturated with species krassilov 1986 rasnitsyn 1987 andjor are subjected to an additional influx of energy and nutrients vermeij 1995 in addition the nonmonotone character of evolution leads to the observation that paleontologists rarely record transitional forms therefore comparatively quick changes are followed by long periods of stagnation even in a changing environment corresponding to the concept of punctuated equilibria gould and eldredge 1977 1993 second as an organism becomes more complex the proportion of prohibited combinations of different features in the space of opportunities also increases zavarzin 1969 1974 hence a single evolutionary change in complex organisms is more taxonomically significant because it overcomes larger gaps of character discontinuity this means that the difference between related complex organisms is more distinct than between simple ones therefore if we determine the velocity of evolution as the rate of extinction and origination of taxa we find that evolution accelerates with the growth of organismal complexity rasnitsyn 1987 this explains the more rapid evolution observed in higher animals in comparison to primitive ones simpson 1944 schmalhausen 1969 form and function i 199 consequence 2 faculty clearance multivariate correspondence offers considerable scope for compensatory interactions in general the greater the number of active faculties in organisms the stronger will be their ability to survive in environments subject to temporal or spatial change rasnitsyn 1966 1971 1972 the ability of animals to use their organs in variable and when necessary novel ways is allowed only because structures are matched loosely to particular behavioral patterns or biologic roles gans 1974 1993 this is the second consequence in other words it can be expressed as one of the following statements changes of structures and functions are relatively independent organisms are not rigid systems biologic construction has a clearance or lost motion for every function and vice versa functioning conditions imposed by natural selection will permit within certain limits selectionneutral changes in structures such a clearance is depicted in figure a2 b by a loose scroll that determines the correspondence between structure and function this clearance explains why different methods of achieving the same functional result can be found within taxons of any level maslov 1980 thus the principle of adaptive tradeoff limits constructional change whereas the second consequence is just the opposite a permitting rule gans 1974 1993 and the two principles are mirror images of each other taken as a whole they neither contradict numerous examples of amazing adaptations nor at the same time the possession by organisms of many features that are neutral and that can be neither eliminated nor supported by natural selection neutral characters can represent the absolute majority of all the taxonomically significant features of living beings schmalhausen 1983 the internal diversity of a taxon is only changed to preserve the archetype of the taxon the archetype is a historically achieved adaptive tradeoff of functions moreover it is evolutionarily stable because it provides adequacy of organisms to the adaptive zone of the taxon a change in principal design means a violation of the tradeoff claims and subsequent loss of adequacy to the adaptive zone therefore such a change can happen only when a new adaptive zone is available occupation of the new zone by organisms results in the formation of a new adaptive tradeoff which is recognized as a new archetype and is interpreted as the appearance of another taxon joint consideration of multivariate correspondence and hierarchic organization leads to the conclusion that the lower the hierarchy the more abundant 200 i appendix are nonadaptive and even antiadaptive structures and functions by contrast the higher the hierarchic level of a function the more adaptive features can be found in structures that fulfill this function this is the main conclusion of this review as a result faculties that belong to lower levels of morphofunctional hierarchy are to a lesser degree subjects for changing the prohibition set by adaptive tradeoff the worth of their constancy is minimal from the perspective of natural selection this is symbolized in figure a2b by the increase in faculty clearance toward the lower part of the pyramid consequently one adaptive novelty on the lower levels can be accompanied by acquisition of several nonadaptive features if they appear to be antiadaptive other lowlevel faculties can be changed for compensation the directions of these changes are mostly determined by the logic of embryonic processes and an environment is free to select adequate phenotypes from a series of opportunities offered by ontogeny even if any particular lowlevel feature is nonadaptive a malfunction can be compensated by multiple doubling of particular functions this consideration fits the early observation that features of major taxa are more often adaptive than those of subordinate groups chetverikov 1926 schmalhausen 1983 neutral characters never occupy a constant position in the phenotypes of higher taxa as evolution proceeds they do not become features specific for major groups optimality and adequacy in recent literature the hypothesis of symmorphosis is extensively discussed structural parameters fit functional requirements cited in garland and huey 1987 see also weibel et al 1991 structures have the form that satisfies maximum necessities but does not exceed them schmidtnielsen 1984 alexander 1988 garland and carter 1994 no more structure is built and maintained than is required to meet functional demand taylor and weibel1981 taylor et al 1996 this viewpoing has been supported by data on the bird respiratory system liem 1988 liquid transport systems labarbera 1990 and the chain process of oxygen and substrate supply for oxidative muscle metabolism weibel et al 1996 in animals the concept of symmorphosis is close if not equal to the statement that faculties are optimal rosen 1967 shwartz 1968 jean 1978 alexander 1996 optimality is quite attractive because it allows calculation and thus an explanation of the structural parameters of organisms it opens a perspective form and function i 201 for predictions which are still rare enough in biology but constitute the main goal for any normal science at first glance the idea of optimality seems to be supported by the concept of stabilizing selection schmalhausen 1949 that minimizes energy waste of the organism also numerous different parameters of plant and animal structures and functions are known to be allometrically related darcy thompson 1942 reeve and huxley 1945 colbert 1948 white and gould 1965 gould 1966 1971 mcmahon 1973 kofman 1981a 1981b 1986 dolnik 1982 swartz and biewener 1992 heinrich 1993 rosen 1967 derived the very fact of allometric relations among parameters directly from the condition of optimality and thus considered allometry as a proof of optimality however rosens conclusions were later shown to be based on a logical mistake kofman 1986 nevertheless allometric relations show that systems of organs operate in such a mode that any change of the major parameters leads to a strong decrease of adaptedness that is to reduced energy flow through the organism as an element of an ecosystem the conclusion about optimality of systems is only the next step since the simplest explanation for stability is that faculties correspond to a local minimum that is optimum so what in an organism corresponds to a local minimum any allometry within a taxon undermines the presence of a similarity that is common traits shared by species of the taxon hence something is kept constant while organisms within the taxon are speciating this something is an invariant character of the taxon archetype allometry only reflects constancy of archetype archetypeforming general faculties are constant not because they themselves are optimal but because their optimization would negatively influence other faculties and cause a decrease in adaptedness of the whole organism this is what we call functional or external constraints on evolution while a new faculty condition that does not affect other functions cannot be achieved owing to developmental or internal constraints thus although structures are suboptimal in relation to functions the phenotype of each species is characterized by the maximum adaptedness that an organism belonging to a particular genus can have within the environment it occupies in other words the phenotype is a local extremum of morphospace this does not mean that the organism is optimal related to the niche it occupies after all a taxon can be partly or what is more rare completely substituted for in its niche or adaptive zone by another taxon of a different general organization implying that the latter fits the niche better for instance mammals active during cool weather and at night replaced reptiles 202 i appendix that were then unable to maintain a high body temperature also numerous examples are given at the species level by the history of invasions of animals and plants elton 1958 and at the level of higher taxa by the very history of life on earth which shows that lowenergy organisms possessing passive functions were gradually substituted by highenergy competitors with more active functions these competitors appeared to be in general more adequate to a vast diversity of niches except for lowenergy environments that did not provide organisms with the amounts of energy sufficient for active functioning see vermeij 1987 for an extensive list of examples allometrical correlation in general should be interpreted carefully data on allometry appear not as lines but as clouds of dots in the space of investigated parameters the simplest procedure and what is normally done is to calculate the general regression line for the group however at the moment it is difficult to say what this line will reflect the inherent properties of the group under study a numerical parameter of its archetype or simply a statistical artifact whether it is formally significant or not typically these regressions are valid only in the range of the data at hand schmidtnielsen 1984 so the first and the most important problem in the calculation of archetypedescribing equations is the selection of the initial data if all available unsorted figures are lumped for analysis it is easy to obtain a line lacking any biologic meaning routine statistical approaches are restricted by structuredness of data statistics normally demand that the scattering of dots within the cloud is purely random and will a priori consider the causality of all deviations to be insignificant still deviations are exactly what we are looking for whenever the optimality of phenotypes is being analyzed whenever the cloud reflects data on the hierarchic system of taxa it must be structured therefore deviations from the general regression line of speciescorresponding dots reflect specificity of natural groups of organisms first and mistakes in measurement last let us return to one of the examples presented under the principle of evolutionary stabilization of functions mcmahon 1975 found the lengths and diameters of forelimb bones of bovidae antelopes sheep goats and cows neither smaller nor greater than that demanded by the theory of elastic similarity hence the hypothesis of optimal elasticity gives a quite satisfying description of the size of forelimb bones in bovidae in addition whenever not one but several families of terrestrial mammals are being considered it becomes evident that the character of interrelationships between parameters form ana function i 203 of the bones and body mass differs in different taxa alexander et al 1979 this should be surprising because different groups possess different skeletal constructions therefore the optimum for an element is defined by the construction within which the element works this circumstance sets strong constraints on our ability to calculate and predict morphologies having obtained a satisfactory explanation for the shape of elements we still lack an explanation for the origin of the system as a whole although this determines the structure of its component elements next suppose that both sets of data reflect true morphofunctional regularities in mammals since the correlation between bone parameters and body mass differs for the mammalia as a whole class and for subordinate taxa it is evident that mammalian organization itself sets its own demands on peculiar structural parameters however the optima for a family or order coincide with general mammalian optima only at the single point at which the two allometry lines cross we can now see that the adaptive radiation undergone by a taxon results at the expense of more or less significant deviations of species phenotypes from both of the two optima in reality it takes place by the deviation from all the optima specific for each higher taxon although this is true it can easily happen that nature contains no single species with parameters that perfectly match the optima defined by archetypal construction of its genus family order and other categories ideally that may be the only species in a type or more directly the only specimen in nature as the phenomenon of variability itself prohibits the idea of optimality hence it is more meaningful to speak of adequacy gans 1993 than of optimality of archetypes the concept of adequacy indicates that within a given adaptive zon any particular organism can exist if it can maintain a number of specimens no less than the minimum needed for reproduction in general the idea of adequacy corresponds to the statment by cuvier that different parts of each being must be coordinated in such a way as to render possible the existence of the being as a whole russell1916 although multifunctionality rarely allows good matching of real parameters to precalculated optima the concept of optimality should not be neglected or forgotten in general optima are useful tools for investigation constituting targets toward which natural selection aims optima are extreme manifestations of archetypes and functional optimality constitutes an important particular case of adequacy a structure can be strongly stabilized within a systematic group particularly if its function is critical to the life of 204 i apper most species throughout the group an example occurs in bovids mcmahon 1975 they may share habitats characterized by extensive ranges and uniform food but also diverse rapidly running predators it is even suggested that the savanna biome originated under the strong influence of large herbivores like ungulates and mainly bovids v v zherikhin personal communication hence bovids have a peculiar kind of highly specialized locomotion evidently neither the skeletal nor the muscle arrangement of bovids can be changed since this would result in a loss of adequacy to their niche therefore speciation in this family which includes more than a hundred recent species proceeded at the cost of other functional systems such as courtship behavior and the accompanying change of horn shape young 1981 colbert and morales 1990 so optimality of parameters of limb bones in bovids indicates that these parameters characterize the skeleton at a given body mass they cannot be considered as traits of species as a byproduct of bone size optimization bovids lost the ability to operate their extremities in the various manners of other mammals all the movements are restricted to foreandaft direction and the relative motility of single limb elements is strongly limited young 1981 supposedly more cases close to the optimum state occur in specialized forms with a reduced amount and diversity of functions studies of optima can sometimes provide important information because the optima set by different functions are the limits among which the archetype is located nevertheless many optima are too far from what we see in nature limits set by such optima evidently cannot guide morphologic research conclusions general principles of organismal construction permit changes that proceed relatively independently in structures and functions thereby enabling the manifestation of both purely morphologic and physiologic aspects in organisms therefore necessary and sufficient explanations of organismal features must include selective and morphogenetic considerations which represent two independent and mutually additive factors of biologic pattern formation the pattern formation can be illustrated by a simple analogy of an evolving organism to a traveling car taking ontogenetic trajectories as roads and natural selection as the driver fig a7 every time environmental conditions change the driver is free to select one from a number of roads offered by ontogeny the paths chosen are adaptive those unchosen are not the latter form and function i 205 time i i _ i i 1 1i i optimal value initial state optimal value structural or functional parameter figure a7 general view of evolution 1 the moment of environmental change are always more numerous it is a wellknown paleontologic fact that the diversity of a taxon abruptly increases before its extinction chernykh 1986 rasnitsyn 1987 of course the traveling car analogy is very simple since our roads are stable in time and can be depicted on a map it may seem that elaboration of an evolutionary prognosis only requires learning of the map in fact 206 i appendix the spectrum of possible forms determined by morphogenesis is generated partly de novo during each elementary evolutionary change thus it cannot be predescribed in the long run the complementarity of the two factors of pattern formation engenders a strong uncertainty of morphologic explanations this uncertainty is not absolutely insuperable since the factors impose different effects on form depending on the level of morphofunctional hierarchy high level systemic features are explained primarily as adaptations whereas lowlevel characters elementary are instead interpreted morphogenetically regrettably i am not equipped to provide full empirical support to this entire set of statements i tried to corroborate it in this book using examples from insect wings and flight i argued that a reliable selectionist explanation can be given to the features that characterize the general construction of the flight system the number of operating wings their relative size and type of interactions while flying these features characterize ordinal taxa by contrast the morphologic peculiarities found on the wings of different small groups mostly lack good selectionist interpretation these materials agree with the general evolutionary considerations of this appendix namely that adaptive properties of morphologic features decrease from the top to the bottom of the organismal constructional hierarchy however this definitely does not imply that adaptive features are absent at the lower levels of morphofunctional hierarchy and that ontogenetically caused traits cannot be found on the top level they doubtless can for example in the venation of insect wings a strengthened radius and cubitus anteriorthe main levels controlling wing movementare clearly adaptive features hence the general conclusion should not be treated as an absolute rule i only want to emphasize the relatively low contribution of adaptive and nonadaptive characters in the total complex of peculiarities of corresponding hierarchic levels thus a new feature that is encountered while studying the morphology of an organism should first be considered from the viewpoint of a levelcorresponding hypothesis that is adaptive for a system of organs and morphogenetic for an element of an organ only after the starting hypothesis is falsified should an alternative explanation be examined this is simply a timesaving approach two apparent contradictions to the proposed ideas must be discussed the first is one can speak of minimal changes in the upper levels of organization only if he knows how to distinguish the upper and lower levels no approach to functional hierarchy is seen besides this one the more taxo form anu unction i 207 nomically and evolutionarily stable is the function the more important it is for the organism thus the higher its rank as a result the rank of a function is determined based on the principle of minimality and if you then try to corroborate it with the help of the same rank system a neverending circle is obtained a p rasnitsyn personal communication indeed differentiation between levels of morphofunctional hierarchy is much easier in theory than in reality it is an eternal philosophical question what is whole and what is part i daresay that concerning this problem characters used to describe a whole determine interrelationships between its parts and correspond to several organs simultaneously accordingly it is not surprising that only these characters appear to be stable under comparison of different groups common to the majority of the taxon members and in sum give owens archetype of the taxon the same is suggested by experience of taxonomy and phylogenetics in which greater weight has traditionally been given to complex features mayr 1969 such as the gross structure of the main organs or the type of symmetry rasnitsyn 1996 the features of construction that determine the coordination of organs are functional by definition and functions at the organismallevel eg the ability to feed move breed are always adaptive hence the higher the taxon level the more adaptive the features characterizing the taxon insect orders are classified according to functional systemstypes of mouthparts and flight apparatuswhereas the animal and plant realms differ only by the source of consumed energy a purely physiologic character so coincidence of mega taxa with living forms seems quite natural and is not a disadvantage of the existing megaclassification as is sometimes thought see koussakin and drozdov 1994 nevertheless functional and morphologic hierarchies do not completely coincide with taxonomic systems not all the features characterizing higher taxa obligatorily occupy high hierarchic levels because features exist that are directly connected with major archetype parameters and thus are quite stable for taxonomic use for example the heatinsulating outer coverings of birds mammals and lepidopterans are associated with the ability of these organisms to maintain constant body temperature the very capacity for thermoregulation could not evolve without association with the appearance of heatinsulating outer structures the presence of the covering is reliably associated with taxonomy although from a morphologic viewpoint it constitutes simply a derivative of epidermis in addition some of the major insect orders papilionida phryganeida vespida are reliably characterized by the 208 i appen anal loop which is very taxonomically stable and originates owing to wing narrowing but plays no adaptive role the second strong contradiction is given by the consideration that in agreement with the principle of minimal change the structures of the lower levels of the morphofunctional hierarchy must be more diverse since they undergo more complete reconstruction during each step of evolution on the one hand this is supported by tissue incompatibility observed even in close species on the other the general organization of animal tissues is much more uniform than that of the fauna zavarzin 1934 1950 1953 the number of tissue types can be compared with the number of major but not medium and minor taxa ways to remove this contradiction are unclear at the moment it can only be stated that from the viewpoint of the presented approach the interpretation of zavarzin 1950 1953 cannot be adopted because it involves the unity of form and function understood as the necessity of functional traits to fit mechanical conditions thus implying the origin of the same form under each given function at the same time the stability of tissue structure appears relatively normal from the perspective of comparative embryology because in ontogeny according to von baers rule tissues are differentiated earlier than morphologic structures and therefore must be more similar note also however that hierarchy constitutes an extremely simple concept in respect to the problems of describing biologic organization a more complex scheme is given by heterarchy a constellation of relatively independent and interrelated functional parts goodwin 1976 heterarchy lacks a predominant part since any of the functional systems can become limiting under particular conditions rasnitsyn 1987 the heterarchic scheme is obtained if we overlap the multivariate correspondence and a hierarchic pyramid without a top the upper surface of this pyramid corresponds to the heterarchic system and hence hierarchy is an adequate approach to describing biologic complexity although it is insufficient when taken alone since the multivariate correspondence between structures and functions is also necessary in principle the top of the morphologic hierarchy is the organism itself whereas the top of the physiologic pyramid is the main function of the
