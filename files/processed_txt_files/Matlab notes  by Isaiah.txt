the manual provided by dr denda is pretty accurate but theres some things that someone who is not used to matlab may overlook and have trouble with i have used matlab before but it has been a while so here is a refreshermy notes so that things run more smoothly for an inexperienced matlab user 1 be sure to be in the root directory or project folder while running the matlab code not the matlab folder or any parent folders this applies for all matlab projects not just this one this is correct see here in the address bar that i am inside the project folder here the project is tombo v4 this is not correct see here in the address bar that i am inside a parent folder in this case it is the matlab folder you can also tell because there are other matlab projects like project1 and exampleproj2 all you need to do is double click tombo v4 and it should look like the firstcorrect picture 2 you may get an error running the code saying some data cannot be fit into a curve this is due to missing one of the toolboxes to install it go to addons under environment category which is under the home tab in the top right look up curve fitting toolbox it should be an official toolbox from matlab from there install it using the button on the right side mine says manage because i already installed it it should then close the matlab install the toolbox then reopen it you should then be able to run the code following dr dendas manual instructionsnotes above tested 2252024 with matlab r2023b curve fitting toolbox 232
