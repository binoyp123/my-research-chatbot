research articles wing rotation and the aerodynamic basis of insect flight michael h dickinson1 fritzolaf lehmann2 sanjay p sane1 insects were the first animals to evolve active flight and remain unsurpassed in many aspects of aerodynamic performance and maneuverability among insects we find animals capable of taking off backwards flying sideways and landing upside down 1 while such complex aerial feats involve many physiological and anatomical specializations that are poorly understood perhaps the greatest puzzle is how flapping wings can generate enough force to keep an insect in the air conventional aerodynamic theory is based on rigid wings moving at constant velocity when insect wings are placed in a wind tunnel and tested over the range of air velocities that they encounter when flapped by the animal the measured forces are substantially smaller than those required for active flight 2 thus something about the complexity of the flapping motion increases the lift produced by a wing above and beyond that which it could generate at constant velocity or that can be predicted by standard aerodynamic theory the failure of conventional steadystate theory has prompted the search for unsteady mechanisms that might explain the high forces produced by flapping wings 3 4 the wingstroke of an insect is typically divided into four kinematic portions two translational phases upstroke and downstroke when the wings sweep through the air with a high angle of attack and two rotational phases pronation and supination when the wings 1 department of integrative biology

correspondence should be addressed email flymanmdsocratesberkeleyedu 1954 rapidly rotate and reverse direction the unsteady mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the elevated performance of insect wings typically emphasize either the translational or rotational phases of wing motion 3 5 8 the first unsteady effect to be identified was a rotational mechanism termed the clap and fling a close apposition of the two wings preceding pronation that hastens the development of circulation during the downstroke 9 although the clap and fling may be important especially in small species it is not used by all insects 10 and thus cannot represent a general solution to the enigma of force production recent studies using real and dynamically scaled models of hawk moths suggest that a translational mechanism termed delayed stall might explain how insect wings generate such large forces 11 at high angles of attack a flow structure forms on the leading edge of a wing that can transiently generate circulatory forces in excess of those supported under steadystate conditions 7 on flapping wings this leading edge vortex is stabilized by the presence of axial flow thereby augmenting lift throughout the downstroke 5 11 several additional unsteady mechanisms have been proposed 6 mostly based on wing rotation but recent studies have found little or no evidence for their use by insects 11 despite this lack of evidence it is unlikely that insects rely solely on translational mechanisms to fly whereas delayed stall might account for enough lift to keep an insect aloft it cannot easily explain how many insects can generate aerodynamic forces that exceed twice their body weight while carrying loads 10 one persistent obstacle in the search for additional unsteady mechanisms is the difficulty in directly measuring the forces produced by a flapping insect 12 in order to further explore the aerodynamic basis of in 18 june 1999 vol 284 science wwwsciencemagorg downloaded from httpswwwscienceorg at rutgers university on december 04 2024 the enhanced aerodynamic performance of insects results from an interaction of three distinct yet interactive mechanisms delayed stall rotational circulation and wake capture delayed stall functions during the translational portions of the stroke when the wings sweep through the air with a large angle of attack in contrast rotational circulation and wake capture generate aerodynamic forces during stroke reversals when the wings rapidly rotate and change direction in addition to contributing to the lift required to keep an insect aloft these two rotational mechanisms provide a potent means by which the animal can modulate the direction and magnitude of flight forces during steering maneuvers a comprehensive theory incorporating both translational and rotational mechanisms may explain the diverse patterns of wing motion displayed by different species of insects sect flight we built a dynamically scaled model of the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster equipped with sensors at the base of one wing capable of directly measuring the time course of aerodynamic forces fig 1a the forces generated by a pattern of wing motion based on drosophila kinematics 13 are shown in fig 1 c through g both the magnitude and the orientation of the mean force coefficient c l 139 inclined at 103 with respect to vertical closely match values measured on tethered flies 14 15 the instantaneous forces are roughly normal to the surface of the wing at all times indicating that at this reynolds number pressure forces dominate the shear viscous forces acting parallel to the wing fig 1c the records show a transient peak in aerodynamic force at the start and end of each upstroke and downstroke fig 1 d and e the timing of these force transients relative to stroke reversal suggests that they result from some undetermined rotational effect and not from a translational mechanism such as delayed stall translational forces in order to test more rigorously whether rotational mechanisms were responsible for the two force peaks straddling stroke reversal we estimated the forces that are generated solely by translation fig 2 we calculated mean translational force coefficients cl and cd from data obtained by moving the wing through a 180 arc at constant velocity and fixed angle of attack 14 to obtain a representative mean value we averaged the measured force coefficients over the interval indicated by the dotted lines in fig 2a the values of the resulting translational lift and drag coefficients are consistent with similar measurements made on a twodimensional 2d model wing at an identical reynolds number 7 the force coefficients of the 3d wing are slightly smaller than the maximum transient values generated by a 2d wing but larger than the 2d steadystate values fig 2d these results confirm the important contribution of delayed stall in lift production during the translational portion of the wing stroke the observation that the 3d force coefficients are lower than the 2d peak transient values but higher than the 2d steadystate values is entirely consistent with the flow patterns generated during force production whereas wing motion in 2d gives rise to an alternating pattern of unstable vortices termed a von karman street 7 the leading edge vortex generated by the 3d model fly wing was stable throughout motion 16 the stability of the flow structure is manifest as constant force generation during translation fig 2 a and b in marked contrast to the 2d case 7 thus as has been previously suggested axial flow along the length of the wing appears to stabilize the leading edge vortex throughout translation 5 11 where research articles as axial flow stabilizes force production at a level greater than that possible under steadystate conditions in 2d the loss of energy from the vortex core probably limits force generation below the maximum 2d level the stability of the force coefficients following an impulsive start justifies the attempt to reconstruct a quasisteady estimate of a translational forces based on stroke kinematics the results of such predictions for drosophila kinematics are shown in fig 1 d and e the calculations do not account for delays in the development of force via the wagner effect 17 and probably represent a slight overestimate of the translational component although the translational values closely match the magnitude of the measured force near the middle of each halfstroke they do not accurately predict the forces during stroke reversal one potential artifact in the measurements of aerodynamic forces during stroke reversal is the contamination by inertial forces due to the linear and angular acceleration

1999 vol 284 science wwwsciencemagorg downloaded from httpswwwscienceorg at rutgers university on december 04 2024 control experiments indicated that the forces generated during stroke reversal could not be explained by either translational or rotational inertia 18 to provide a rough time course of rotational effects we subtracted the translational prediction of lift from the measured value rotational lift fig 1f the subtraction reveals two clear force peaks bracketing each stroke reversal for the drosophila kinematics shown in fig 1 rotational effects contribute roughly 35 of the total lift production throughout the strokea high value considering the brief duration over which they act rotational circulation the presence of two rotational force peaks separated in time suggests that they might represent distinct aerodynamic mechanisms one possible explanation for the force peak at the end of each halfstroke is that the wings own rotation serves as a source of circulation to generate an upward force 6 19 this mechanism rotational circulation is akin to the magnus effect which makes a spinning baseball curve from its path toward the plate 20 the surface of a rotating ball pulls air within the boundary layer as it spins thus serving as a source of circulation as the ball moves through the air this circulation will increase the total flow velocity on one side and decrease it on the other if the velocity is higher on the top as in the case of backspin the ball is pulled upward by the lower pressure in the case of topspin the net velocity is higher below and the ball is pulled downward if a flapping wing generates lift via a mechanism similar to the magnus effect then the orientation of the resulting force should also depend critically on the direction of wing rotation to adopt the proper angle of attack for each translational phase the wing must pronate before the downstroke and supinate before the upstroke see wing sections in figs 1c and 3e if the wing flips early before reversing direction then the leading edge rotates backward relative to translation research articles translational component a e total lift advanced downstroke 025 500 mn 0

rotation is advanced the wing develops lift and drag after translation has ceased when wing rotation is symmetrical and stops in a vertical position the posttranslation force is pure drag with no lift

orientation of local fluid velocity fluid velocity is also indicated by pseudocolor background although the gross orientation of the flow is similar in all three cases the flow velocities are greater

velocimetry 16 18 june 1999 vol 284 science wwwsciencemagorg downloaded from httpswwwscienceorg at rutgers university on december 04 2024 a time course of this posttranslational force is similar to that of the force transients at the start of each halfstroke during continuous flapping the flow visualizations made immediately before stroke reversal reveal peakinduced velocities that are comparable to the maximum translational velocity of the wing and of sufficient magnitude to generate the observed forces after the wing changes direction fig 4b whereas the timing of the wake capture force is constant its magnitude and direction depend on the phase relationship between rotation and translation fig 4 a and b if rotation precedes stroke reversal the wing intercepts its own wake so as to generate positive lift if rotation is delayed until the start of the downstroke then the flow intercepts force n 1958 previous stroke as has been demonstrated on 2d models of flapping insect wings the flow generated by one stroke can increase the effective fluid velocity at the start of the next stroke and thereby increase force production above that which could be explained by translation alone 8 because a significant portion of the fluid velocity that a wing encounters at the start of each stroke is due to the lingering wake one clear prediction of the wake capture hypothesis is that a wing should continue to generate force at the end of a halfstroke even if it came to a complete stop we tested this prediction by examining the time course of forces after halting wing motion at the end of the upstroke as shown in fig 4 the wing generates force for several hundred milliseconds following the end of translation the force n set of simplified wing kinematics 21 see peaks labeled with black dots in fig 3 a through c an advance in rotation relative to translation fig 3 a and g results in a positive lift peak at the end of each halfstroke whereas a delay in rotation results in negative lift at the beginning of each halfstroke fig 3 c and g as predicted symmetrical rotation causes a positive peak before and a negative peak after stroke reversal fig 3 b and g thus by properly adjusting the timing of wing rotation an insect can generate lift via a rotational mechanism in excess of that produced by delayed stall the physics of rotating wings and baseballs differ in one important way however baseballs are round and insect wings are flat this has two important consequences for the forces generated by rotational circulation first because pressure forces act at all times perpendicular to an objects surface the rotational force on a wing will act normal to its chord not perpendicular to the direction of motion as is the case with a spinning baseball 4 this influence is easily seen in the plots of the instantaneous force vector superimposed over the wing chord figs 1c and 3e as the angle of attack exceeds 90 the force vector dips below the stroke plane and the sign of lift changes from positive to negative second viscous forces within the air will make the flow above and below a flat wing fuse smoothly at the sharp trailing edge this constraint termed the kutta condition fixes a fluid stagnation point at the trailing edge of the wing the functional consequence of the kutta condition is that the amount of circulation and thus force produced by a rotating wing will depend critically upon the position of the rotational axis 6 19 we confirmed this prediction by measuring total rotational circulation in a series of experiments in which we systematically varied the axis of rotation by changing the attachment point of the wing on the flapping apparatus fig 3f as predicted rotational circulation decays as the axis of rotation is moved toward the trailing edge changing sign at approximately threefourths of a chord length from the leading edge of the wing this result provides further evidence that force peaks generated during stroke reversal are due to rotational circulation wake capture although rotational circulation can explain one of the stroke reversal forces it cannot explain the large positive transient that develops immediately after the wing changes direction at the start of each half stroke white dots fig 3 a through c these peaks are distinct from the rotational circulation peaks in that their timing is independent of the phase of wing rotation one possible explanation for these forces is the mechanism of wake capture in which the wing benefits from the shed vorticity of the research articles circulation effect underscores a remarkable feature of the wake capture mechanism the animals ability to extract energy from its own wake in general wakes are a manifestation of the energy lost to the external medium by a moving object by rapidly changing direction at the end of each translational phase an insect wing can recover energy from the air that was lost during the previous stroke greatly improving the overall efficiency of force production rotational forces and flight control any general theory of insect flight aerodynamics needs to explain not only how animals produce enough lift to stay in the air but also how they can modulate flight forces during steering maneuvers the results we describe indicate that rotational circulation and wake capture though distinct phenomena nevertheless interact synergistically in a way that makes them useful mechanisms for a downstroke 500 mn cl187 upstroke b translational component total lift 08 lift n 06 04 02 0 02

time history of measured rotational red and translational estimates blue of lift rotational lift and kinematic velocities translation green and rotational purple velocities are shown at bottom controlling aerodynamic forces an advance in wing rotation not only generates circulatory forces at the end of each stroke it also increases the strength of the wake and ensures that the wing has the proper orientation to use the shed vorticity for generating positive lift at the start of the next stroke as a consequence of this synergy flight force is exquisitely sensitive to the phase of wing rotation a phase advance of 8 from the delayed to symmetrical conditions of fig 3 increases the mean lift coefficient by 67 fig 3f in contrast the mean lift coefficient predicted from translational mechanisms does not change with the timing of wing rotation this sensitivity of the forces to rotational timing is consistent with the kinematic changes exhibited by drosophila during steering behaviors during visually induced maneuvers flies advance the timing of supination on the wing outside of a turn and delay supination on the wing inside of a turn 22 according to the above results this alteration would help to generate the required change in yaw torque by advancing the timing of rotation on both wings a fly could generate the symmetrical increase in force required for forward or upward acceleration a general theory of insect flight the ability to explain general phenomena determines the ultimate utility of any theory in biology are these results based on the kinematics of small flies applicable to other insects although our impression of insect diversity is strongly influenced by animals large enough to be noticeable the length of the average insect is 4 to 5 mm only slightly larger than drosophila 23 therefore most insects operate within a reynolds number regime that is similar to that of our robotic fly however the most rigorous test of our model is in its application to insects using radically different patterns of wing motion the peculiar kinematics of hoverflies often considered the most aerodynamically sophisticated of all insects 1 provide one such test the stroke amplitude of hoverflies is quite small and the angular rotation of the wing is rapid using published data 13 we generated a series of kinematic patterns based on hoverfly wing motion the forces generated by a simple hoverfly pattern consisting of symmetrical upstroke and downstroke motion are shown in fig 5 the discrepancy between measured forces and those predicted from translational force coefficients is especially large the wing motion generates two distinct force peaks at the beginning and end of each halfstroke that are consistent with especially potent examples of rotational circulation and wake capture although our conclusions are limited by the fact that most hoverflies operate at a higher reynolds number re 500 than we are currently able to recreate re

symmetrical rotation the wing has a 90 angle of attack at the midpoint of stroke reversal and produces no lift but high drag if stopped at the end of the upstroke figure 4b also shows that the peak velocities in the near wake are much greater when rotation is advanced relative to stroke reversal this result is expected because the rotational circulation generated at the end of the previous halfstroke is greater under these conditions resulting in stronger vorticity shed within the wake collectively the combined effect of wake strength and the starting angle of attack explains why during continuous flapping the lift peaks caused by wake capture are large and positive if rotation is advanced small and positive if rotational is symmetrical and small and negative if rotation is delayed

mass acceleration and gravity from our measurements however the mass of fluid attached to the wing added mass is a dynamic quantity that may change with speed and angle of attack and is thus difficult to model either physically or mathematically in order to test whether rotational transients might be caused by the translational inertia of added mass we repeated our experiments using a modified kinematic pattern in which the translation of the wing was limited to a flat stroke plane fig 3 under these conditions added mass acceleration might contribute to an error in the measurement of drag but it should not contaminate the measurement of the lift as indicated in fig 3a the two large lift transients are still present during stroke reversal when the wing is flapped using the simplified kinematic pattern indicating that added mass accelerations cannot explain the rotational forces in order to test whether our results were contaminated by rotational inertia we rotated the model wing

though significant is small relative the effects of delayed stall rotational circulation and wake capture at closest approach the wing tip came within 22 cm of the top surface 18 cm from the side walls and 160 cm from the bottom of the tank in order to test that the forces measured within the enclosed tank did not deviate from those expected in an infinite volume we carefully mapped the change in force production with distance from the tank boundaries in three separate sets of experiments we moved the robotic apparatus incrementally toward each boundary and measured the forces generated by the drosophila kinematic pattern shown in fig 1 the changes in mean lift coefficient with distance from the solidliquid side and bottom and airliquid top interfaces were closely approximated by

repeated experiments using a flexible composite wing consisting of a plexiglas leading edge and a thin metal foil blade the thickness of the foil was chosen to produce deformations comparable to those observed in real flies the use of flexible wings did not significantly alter any of the findings although forces measured with rigid wings were typically higher than those measured with flexible wings the sensor was a miniaturized version of a design used in a previous 2d study 7 one sensor measured total force normal to the surface of the wing while the other measured the force parallel to the surface in the chordwise direction preliminary experiments indicated that lengthwise parallel forces were negligible compared to the other components and have been ignored lift and drag forces defined conventionally with respect to wing motion were constructed trigonometrically from the normal and parallel channels we deliberately designed the sensor to measure shear deflection and not cantilever bending so that measurements would not be sensitive to the loading distribution on the wing forces measured with calibration weights placed at the base tip trailing edge and leading edge of the wing differed by 5 the final calibration was based on static loading at the wings center of area during data collection we used a lowpass fourpole bessel filter with a cutoff frequency of 10 hz roughly 50 times the flapping frequency spectral analysis indicated that this filter introduced no appreciable phase lag within the range of relevant frequencies during subsequent offline analysis we conditioned each signal using an 8pole recursive digital filter butterworth with a cutoff of 5 hz and zero phase delay implemented in matlab mathworks inc each trial consisted of a burst of four continuous wing strokes four such bursts were averaged for each experimental condition force measurements during the first cycle of each burst were slightly different due to transient effects and have been excluded from the present analysis each experiment was repeated using an inertial model consisting of a short brass cylinder machined to have an equal mass and center of mass to that of the wing the data from the inertial model were subtracted from the raw wing data to remove the contributions of wing inertia and gravity supported by grants from nsf ibn9723424 defense advanced research projects agency and

appear to make a more extensive use of rotational mechanisms than do fruit flies in any event this exercise indicates that while a theory of insect flight based purely on translation could not explain the complex time history of forces generated by hoverfly kinematics the hoverfly pattern fits well within a more general model that incorporates both translational and rotational mechanisms in summary direct measurements of the forces produced by flapping wings suggest that the aerodynamics of insect flight may be explained by the interaction of three distinct yet interactive mechanisms delayed stall rotational circulation and wake capture whereas delayed stall is a translational mechanism rotational circulation and wake capture depend explicitly on the pronation and supination of the wing during stroke reversal these findings are significant for several reasons first delayed stall is not sufficient alone to explain the elevated aerodynamic performance required for active flight in drosophila the rotational mechanisms we describe are necessary components of the basic unsteady aerodynamic toolkit in this species 24 second a more general theory of insect aerodynamics that incorporates both translational and rotational mechanisms shows promise in explaining the forcegenerating mechanisms of many species as suggested by the forces generated by hoverfly kinematics different insects may emphasize the translational and rotational mechanisms to different degrees it will be of interest in the future to compare the relative energetic and aerodynamic efficiency of translationally and rotationally dominated kinematic patterns finally the regulation of rotational phase provides insects with one of the most potent means of controlling flight forces during steering maneuvers thus an understanding of rotational mechanisms provides a link between the unsteady aerodynamics and the behavior and neurobiology of flight control
