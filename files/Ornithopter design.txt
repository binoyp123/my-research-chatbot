ornithopter design jay kapasiawala introduction the goal was to create an ornithopter fourwinged flapping drone that could produce a flapping motion asynchronously between the front and rear set of wings as well as inducing a pitching motion in the each of the wings additionally the features that allow for stroke angle pitch angle and other parameters to be set needed to be adjustable so that they could be redesigned to account for optimized values of each of these parameters stirling hot air engine final render final render transmission devices components ball joint ball joint sliders pitch angle stroke angle future direction so now that the assembly has been constructed all of these parameters can be adjusted to achieve the stroke angle stroke plane angle and pitch angle that are desired
