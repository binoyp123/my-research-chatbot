ﬂapping problems in 2d applied to insect ﬂight study mitsunori denda roberta shapiro and justin wong mechanical and aerospace engineering department rutgers university piscataway nj usa abstract the secrets of the ﬂapping of insects with two pairs of wings primarily dragonﬂies have been revealed experimentally and numerically although there exist many excellent experimental studies numerical study is limited due to the highly demanding nature of the numerical approach to the unsteady ﬂapping problems recently we have developed a vortexbased method for the singlewing ﬂapping problems in 2d the simplicity and the accuracy of the method developed have encouraged us to extend the method to problems with two pairs of wings the outcome is reported in this paper we consider the species with a long wing span for which the ﬂow ﬁeld in the span direction is constant and treated as 2d article history received 29 november 2017 accepted 19 november 2018 keywords vortex method twowing two pairs of wings ﬂapping 2d unsteady ﬂow insect ﬂight 1 introduction while birds and ﬂying mammals use their wing muscles and bones to actively morph the wing contour insects use passive mechanisms that rely on the wing structural design to achieve the optimal wing shape the absence of an additional control mechanism in insect wings makes them light and suited for adaptation in the design of extremely lightweight microareal vehicles another distinction between birds and insects is the number of wings birds have two wings while ﬂying insects have four according to wigglesworth 1972 in orthoptera grasshopper cricket katydid and locust neuroptera lacewing mantidﬂy and antlion isoptera termite and odonata dragonﬂy and damselﬂy the fore and hindwings move independently wigglesworth compares the ﬂight of orthoptera and lower neuroptera to that of odonata dragonﬂies while the upstroke and downstroke of the forewings for the former group of insects are in advance of the hindwings dragonﬂies

functional unit to avoid the disadvantage of the second pair of wings working in a region of turbulence produced by the ﬁrst pair although there exist many excellent experimental studies rival widmann tropea 2012 thomas taylor srygley nudds bomphery 2004 there are few numerical studies of two pairs of wings including the blade element method azuma watanabe 1988 the upwind diﬀerencing scheme wang sun 2005 and the immersed boundary method wang russell 2007 due to the highly demanding nature of the numerical approach to the unsteady ﬂapping problems so far dragonﬂies have been studied almost exclusively but it will be instructive to shed light to the ﬂight of other insects the primary goal of this paper is to develop a simple but accurate numerical method for analysing the unsteady ﬂuid ﬂow generated by the pairs of fore and hindwings moving independently we consider insects with a long wing span for which the ﬂow ﬁeld in the span direction is constant and then reduce the problem to 2d in which the original fore and hind pairs four wings in 3d are modelled by two wings in 2d represented by one forewing and one hindwing the vortexbased method used in this paper has been veriﬁed as simple but highly reliable for the study of unsteady ﬂapping aerodynamics for one pair of wings modelled by a singlewing in 2d denda jujjavarapu jones 2016 the ﬂow observed in the ﬂapping ﬂight has a low reynolds number for which the viscous eﬀects are important and the wake region is turbulent the proposed vortex approach that models the viscous boundary layers on the wings and the turbulent wake region surrounding the wings is capable of modelling the realistic viscous and turbulent ﬂows the method is applicable regardless of the reynolds number for large reynolds numbers the number of vortices increases and the problem of turbulence is reduced to the manywakevortices problem in the inviscid ﬂuid in this paper the method originally developed for the single pair of wings is extended to the two pairs of wings in 2d for simplicity the former is called the singlewing problem and the latter the twowing problem 2 coordinate systems for insects with a long wing span the ﬂow remains approximately constant in the span direction this justiﬁes the twodimensional 2d modelling of wing motion this paper considers such a class of 2d wing motions for which the ﬂow ﬁeld does not change in the outofplane direction two inﬁnitely long wings in the span direction are represented by their european journal of computational mechanics 3 intersections with the twodimensional plane as two thin chords of wings the wings are assumed rigid the position of each wing is described locally by the wingﬁxed η as system o η and globally by the spaceﬁxed system o shown in figure 1 each wing undergoes

motion of the individual insect wing in threedimensions consists of three rotational components roll pitch and yaw and three translational components in 2d the roll is recast as a translational motion consisting of the heave up and down and lunge forward and back components the pitch remains as the same in 3d and the yaw does not exist superimposed upon these rotational contributions is the translational motion of the insect in the negative spaceﬁxed coordinate direction while the rolling of a ﬁnite length insect wing in 3d is described by the rotation around the body axis it is represented in 2d by a translational motion horizontal or lunge l and vertical or heave h components of an inﬁnitely long wing along the stroke line additionally the wing rotates about the wing span axis to produce the pitch measured by the angle γ positive clockwise the forward pitch downstroke direction with γ 0 and backward pitch upstroke direction with γ 0 are called the pronation and supination respectively consider a 3d rolling motion of an insect wing of the span length l ¼ 2l over a stroke plane which is the trajectory of the centre line of the wing span let the upper and lower extents of the rolling motion be given by the upper and lower stroke angles ϕt and ϕb as shown in figure 3 these three quantities taken from the actual insect ﬂight motions are used to specify the extent of the stroke line by the trajectory of the midpoint l of the span into the 2d plane since the linear distance travelled by points along the wing span increases from 0 at the base to the maximum at the wing tip its projection is taken at the midpoint giving the average the time variation of the lunge and heave is expressed using the sinusoidal function l φt φb l sin φt l sin φb stroke

al γ γm pronation supination 0 t2 t t pronation γm figure 4 perfect pronation and supination the pitch motion occurs as a sudden rotation described by the step function of the wing at the extremes of each stroke symmetric pitch as shown in figure 4 it consists of the pronation in the downward direction and the supination in the upward direction at the top and the bottom of the stroke respectively the pitch motions that occur before and after reaching the top or bottom are called advanced and delayed pitches respectively most insects do not have the capability to pitch instantaneously and the rotation is smoothed out throughout the stroke a smooth step function as shown in figure 5 is used the eﬀect of the insect ﬂight speed ðu vþ is incorporated by moving the wing itself in the direction opposite to the air velocity under zero ambient velocity the nonzero ambient velocity can be superimposed over this for a constant air velocity the total translational motion of the wing is obtained by superimposing the contributions l lunge and h heave from the ﬂapping motion and the air velocity to give ðl ut h vtþ where t is the time all of the variables describing wing position are displayed in figure 1 here ðl ut h vtþ gives the coordinates of the wingtranslating sys α gives the slope of the axis of the wingﬁxed system and a tem origin o is the distance between the origins of the wingﬁxed and wingtranslating are systems notice that the coordinates of the bodyﬁxed system origin c given by ðut vtþ additionally the slope of the body axis is δ and the of the stroke line coordinate

the camber of the wing can readily be introduced by replacing i in equation 2 by the complex valued unit normal to the curved wing 32 motion of two wings the motion of the second wing is described exactly in the same manner as the ﬁrst wing mentioned above when two wings are present parameters for each wing are distinguished from those of the other wing by using the subscripts f and h for the fore and hindwings as seen in figure 2 european journal of computational mechanics 9 4 vortex equations 41 single vortex the vortices used in this paper are conveniently described in terms of complex variables sears 2011 consider a line vortex with the circulation γ positive counterclockwise located at ζ0 ¼ 0 þ i η0 its complex potential function is given by iγ ωðζþ ¼ logðζ ζ0 þ 2π 4 where ζ ¼ þ i η and ζ0 are complex position vectors in the spaceﬁxed system the corresponding conjugate complex velocity is given by dω iγ 1 ¼ vðζþ ¼ ζ ζ 2π dζ 0 5 where vðζþ ¼ v þ ivη and an overbar ð þ indicates the complex conjugate to avoid an excessively high value of the velocity when it is evaluated in the neighbourhood of the source point we introduce the vortex core model denda et al 2016 for which equation 5 is used outside the core radius only within the core radius the velocity changes linearly from 0 to a value given by equation 5 on the radius of the core 42 discretisation of the wing for each wing introduce m vortices γj at ζ0j ðj ¼ 1 2 mþ and m 1 collocation points ζi ði ¼ 1 2 m 1þ on the wing the collocation points are placed at the midpoints of vortex points the number of vortices for two wings mf and mh may diﬀer notice the subscript convention f and h used for the twowing system we place vortices at the leading le and trailing te edges and in between the spacing of the vortex points could be equidistant at the middle and gradually narrowed towards the two end points which are mathematically known singular points the details are given by denda et al 2016 43 inﬂuence coeﬃcients for the twowing system there are two types of inﬂuence coeﬃcients between vortices located on the two wings self and crossinﬂuence functions the complex conjugate velocity at the forewing collocation point ζfi due to a forewing vortex γfj at ζf0j is given by 10 m denda et al vfi fj ¼ iγfj 1 2π ζ fi ζ f0j 6 the normal component of this velocity at the forewing collocation point is given from equation 3 by γ n f fi fi þ ¼ j vfnfi fj ¼ ðvfi fj n 7 vfniffj γ fj ζ ζ 2π fi f0j fi is given by equation 2 at the forewing collocation point is where n the imaginary part of a complex variable and fi 1 n f n v fi fj ¼ 8 ζ ζ 2π fi f0j is the selfinﬂuence coeﬃcient for the forewing another selfinﬂuence function for the hindwing vhnhi hj is obtained from equation 8 by replacing the subscript f by h two more crossinﬂuence functions that describe the interaction between the fore and hindwings vfnifhj and vhnhi fj are obtained similarly for example the former is the crossinﬂuence function for the normal velocity on a forewing collocation point fi due to a hindwing vortex γ hj 5 system of equations for discrete vortices on two wings 51 contribution from the bound vortices on two wings in this subsection we only consider bound vortices on the two wings the eﬀect of the wake vortices is added in the next subsection at the forewing collocation point ζfi calculate the normal velocity component contributions from the discrete bound vortices of the fore and hindwings to get vfnif ¼ mf x fj ¼1 vfniffj γfj þ mh x hj ¼1 vfnifhj γhj 9 where vfniffj is given by equation 8 and vfnifhj is one of crossinﬂuence coeﬃcients between two wings the nonpenetration condition requires that this normal velocity must be equal to the normal velocity of the forewing vfnif at each collocation point mf x fj ¼1 vfniffj γfj þ mh x hj ¼1 vfnifhj γhj ¼ vfnif 10 european journal of computational mechanics 11 for collocation points fi ¼ 1 2 mf 1 an additional equation required to match the number of mf unknowns γfi for the forewing is given by the conservation of the forewing vortices mf x γfj ¼ 0 11 fj ¼1 similarly the system of equations for the hindwing is obtained by swapping the subscripts f

0 13 hj ¼1 notice that the vortex conservation condition is applied for each wing independently in order to provide two additional equations thus securing the suﬃcient number of equations and matching the total number of bound vortices mf þ mh 52 contribution from the wake vortices at each time step a pair of forewing vortices from the leading fj ¼ mf and trailing fj ¼ 1 edges are shed from the forewing this results in during the p th time period 2ðp 1þ forewing wake vortices ½k ½k γf1 and γfm 14 located at ½p½k ζ f1 and ½p½k ζfm 15 where the presuperscript ½p ðþ indicates the current step ½p and the postsuperscript ðþ½k k ¼ 1 2 p 1 indicates the originating time step since the values of γ f s remain constant once the vortices are shed into the ﬂow they do not have the presuperscript following the procedure used in the previous subsection for the calculation of bound vortexinduced velocity we can obtain denda et al 2016 the normal compoh n of forewing wakeinduced velocity at the fore nents ½p vfniffp and ½p vh i fp and hindwing collocation points ζ and ζ respectively fi hi 12 m denda et al the eﬀects of the wake vortices shed from the hindwing can be treated h n of hindsimilarly to obtain the normal components ½p vfnfi hp and ½p vh i hp wing wakeinduced velocity at the fore and hindwing collocation points ζ and ζ respectively fi hi equations 10 and 12 are now augmented with the contributions from the wake vortices yielding mf x fj ¼1 vfniffj γfj þ mh x hj ¼1 vfnifhj γhj þ½p vfnfi fp þ½p vfnifhp ¼ vfnif 16 and mf x fj ¼1 vhnhi fj γfj þ mh x hj ¼1 vhnhi hj γhj þ h ½p n vh i fp þ h ½p n vh i hp ¼ vhnhi 17 notice that for the ﬁrst step the wake is absent and so are the augmented wake vortex contributions in equations 16 and 17 6 convection of wake vortices shedding of bound edge vortices and the kutta condition in our proposed method the kutta condition is not enforced at the le and te of two wings belotserkovsky kotovskii nisht fedorov 1993 belotserkovsky lifanov 2003 denda et al 2016 instead the bound vortices at these points are shed regularly at each time step right after shedding the two edges of each wing lose vortices to eﬀectively satisfy the kutta condition momentarily until the new bound vortices are built up in the next time step all wake vortices are convected using the velocity calculated at the wake vortices the velocity contributions come from the bound and wake vortices of the two wings 7 time marching solution procedure in the time marching solution procedure we prescribe the wing position and velocity of two wings for each time step then determine the magnitudes of the bound vortices using the nonpenetration condition equations 16 and 17 and vortex conservation equations equations 11 and 13 for two wings next calculate the induced velocity at the te and le of two wings and wake vortex sites finally shed the edge vortices and convect the wake vortices we repeat the whole process for the subsequent time steps for a detailed description of the time marching solution procedure for the single wing see denda et al 2016 which is essentially the same for twowing case in this paper european journal of computational mechanics 13 8 impulses and forcemoment 81 spaceﬁxed system denda et al 2016 have shown that the linear and angular impulses of a line vortex located at ζ ¼ þ i η with the circulation γ are given by iργζ 18 1 ργjζj2 2 19 and where γ is a signed circulation with positive counterclockwise orientation the time derivatives of the linear and angular impulses will provide the force and moment exerted by the vortex onto the air the force and moment acting on the two wings are obtained by reversing the signs of those obtained for the air notice that these are the resultants on the two wings and the current approach cannot identify those acting on the individual wing 82 wingtranslating system the linear and angular impulses must be calculated in the spaceﬁxed system however the angular momentum about the origin of the spaceﬁxed system is inapplicable in practical applications rather it of the bodyﬁxed system see should be calculated about the origin c figure 2 the problem however is that its origin is moving to resolve this issue we introduce another spaceﬁxed system that has the same origin as the bodyﬁxed system and calculate the angular impulse in this coordinate system although this system needs to be updated as the bodyﬁxed system moves each one of them in time history is a spaceﬁxed system and is the legitimate system for the calculation of the impulses η and the body consider ﬁrst the original spaceﬁxed system o c η c the transformation between the two systems is ﬁxed system c given by ζ ¼ r þ ζ c 20 where ζc ¼ c þ i ηc and r ¼ ut ivt substitute this relation into equations 18 and 19 and simplify to obtain i ¼ i ia ¼ ia þ ðriþ where 21 14 m denda et al 1 i ¼ iργζ and ia ¼ ργjζj2 2 22 now take the time derivative in equation 21 to get the force and moment _ _ _ f ¼ i ¼ i e ¼ ia ¼ ia þðr_ iþ þ ðriþ 23 at this point we switch from the original spaceﬁxed system to the spaceﬁxed system that is placed on top of the bodyﬁxed system for which r ¼ 0 giving the updated relations f ¼ i_ ¼ i_ ¼ i_a ¼ i_a þ ðr_ iþ 24 where r_ ¼ u þ iv is the conjugate complex velocity of the coordinate origin of the bodyﬁxed system due to the wing translational motion finally the c force and moment acting on the two wings are obtained by reversing the signs in 2d the force and moment are calculated per unit depth consider an insect with the span length l ¼ 2l in 3d the wing undergoes a radial ﬂapping motion about the wing base in the 2d adaptation of this ﬂapping motion we determine its stroke line length d by projecting the 3d ﬂapping motion of the midpoint at l rather than the wing tip at 2l in order to represent the average stroke line length of the 3d ﬂapping wing note that the programme inputs the halfspan length l and obtains the force and moment per unit span length the total force and moment are calculated by multiplying the span length l ¼ 2l counting wings on the right and left we further double the total force and moment 9 evaluation of numerical performance the vortex method used in this paper is essentially the inﬂuence function method similar to the bem boundary element method in comparison to the domain methods such as the fvm ﬁnite volume method and fem ﬁnite element method the domain method in the extension from the single to multiplewing analysis must be carefully reexamined the strategies working for the singlewing analysis may not work for multiplewing case any more for example when two wings get closer the mesh between them must be reﬁned accordingly which is not required for the singlewing analysis the inﬂuence function method depends on the concept of closeness between two points in the ﬁeld or the distance between the source and observation points because of this the strategies developed for the singlewing analysis remain valid for multiplewing case regardless of the relative position of the multiple wings in other words the strategies dealing with the european journal of computational mechanics 15 closeness of multiplewing case are already built in the singlewing analysis if they work for the singlewing analysis then they also work for multiplewing case this fact plays a key role in extending the vortex method from the single to the multiplewing case there is no question that the veriﬁcation must be performed for the singlewing case against the established method such as the fvm as in denda et al 2016 after this however there is not need to verify the vortex method against the multiplewing case in the following we review the strategies developed to deal with the closeness between two points in the singlewing analysis denda et al 2016 have evaluated the numerical performance of the proposed vortex method for a singlewing problem in 2d first the closeness between two bound vortices is explored the spacial resolution is determined by the number of bound vortices m which determines the spacing between bound vortices the ﬁrst candidate for the time increment δtd depends on the heave motion and is determined by m and the stroke line length d such that the distance covered by the heave motion in a time increment is equal to the spacing between the bound vortices another candidate δtp is determined by the pitch speed p see appendix b such that the pitch event is fully contained within the time increment the smaller of the two is used for the actual time increment notice that m is the only nonphysical parameter that can be selected independently from all other physical parameters including d and p that deﬁne the problem denda et al 2016 compared the solution with results obtained by a navierstokes solver openfoam weller tabor jasak fureby 1998 based on the fvm second the closeness between the vortex source and the observation is explored when we evaluate the velocity obviously the velocity increases as we get closer to a vortex the strategy to avoid this type of singularity is employed by introducing the vortex core model or rankine vortex next the numerical performance for the singlewing case is summarised as m is increased the solution has improved rapidly for m ¼ 3 5 10 15 20 the solution stabilised and approached towards the openfoam solution around m ¼ 20 25 30 35 but began to deviate from the openfoam solution after m ¼ 35 the solution does not seem to converge to the viscous solution as we increase m for a large m the wake is packed with vortices and unless special techniques such as lumping nearby vortices or allowing vortex decay numerical diﬃculties are expected even with the use of vortex core model designed to avoid this problem for m ¼ 35 the vortex method is approximately 20 times faster than the openfoam rather than attempting to achieve the convergence to the reference solution obtained by the navierstokes solver it would be wise to know the 16 m denda et al limit of the present method and use it in the range that gives the optimal results our surprising discovery is that although the results using a small m are quantitatively inferior they still preserve the essence of the solution qualitatively for a smaller mð 35þ the vortex method is signiﬁcantly more than 20 times faster than the openfoam we have found that for m 35 the computational time increases exponentially but the numerical results deteriorate as compared to the openfoam solution the optimal value of m determined by the accuracy and the computation time is therefore around 35 the above observation gives us the best use of the proposed method as a quick solver for unsteady ﬂapping problems using a small m such as m ¼ 5 and m ¼ 10 we can explore the unknown unsteady behaviour of the ﬂapping ﬂight once we discover an interesting phenomenon or behaviour we can increase m up to m ¼ 35 for more accurate results if the phenomenon needs to be further scrutinised then we switch to a navierstokes solver we can remain conﬁdent that using this method with a small m both captures the essential behaviour and yields quick calculations we assume that the characteristics of the vortex method discovered for the singlewing case remain true for the twowing case considered here this assumption is quite safe since in the transition from the singlewing to twowing case no new elements in the numerical algorithm are introduced to complete the evaluation of numerical performance we have performed a convergence study for the twowing problem which is speciﬁed by table 1 the case of synchronous ﬂapping zero phase shit was considered figures 7 and 8 show the variation of the lift force fy and the drag force fx over one period from the start for various values of m up until m ¼ 20 the value of the forces jumped quickly until the variation slowed down after m ¼ 20 to show the sign of convergence towards m ¼ 35 the situation is very similar to the case of singlewing and we expect the solution begins to diverge after m ¼ 35 indicating the optimum value of m is between m ¼ 20 and m ¼ 35 comparison of the vortex method solutions with those by the navierstokes solver for the twowing problem is in preparation table 1 flight parameters for the dragonﬂy common to fore and hindwings translational velocity wing

pair of wings in insect ﬂight according to wigglesworth 1972 in hymenoptera bee wasp tricoptera caddisﬂy lepidoptera butterﬂy moth and hemiptera true bugs fore and hindwings are united by various mechanisms to make a functional unit to avoid the disadvantage of the second pair of wings working in a region of turbulence produced by the ﬁrst pair in orthoptera grasshopper cricket katydid and locust neuroptera lacewing mantidﬂy and antlion isoptera termite and odonata dragonﬂy and damselﬂy the fore and hindwings move independently wigglesworth compares the ﬂight of orthoptera and lower neuroptera to that of odonata dragonﬂies while the upstroke and downstroke of the forewings for the former group of insects are in advance of the hindwings the dragonﬂies reverse the order of the wing beat to avoid the diﬃculty notice that the order of the hindwing and the forewing beating is relative in the cyclic beating situation and there is no absolute way to specify which beats ﬁrst rather this issue should be addressed in terms of the phase shift of the hindwing beating relative to the forewing which ranges from 0 to 360 therefore we ﬁrst investigate the eﬀects of the phase shift in the twowing ﬂapping the geometric wing chord wing length fore and hindwing separation distance kinematic stroke plane angle stroke angles pitch shift and kinetic parameters ﬂapping frequency ﬂight speed pitch rate are determined from a sample dragonﬂy species and its highspeed ﬂight video as listed in table 1 the exact identiﬁcation of the dragonﬂy is not important in this study since we are not investigating dragonﬂy ﬂight itself 101 the eﬀects of phase shift using the parameters in table 1 taken from a typical dragonﬂy we have performed ﬂight analysis by varying the phase shift of the hindwing relative to the forewing the initial position of the forewing is at its maximum upper stroke angle ϕt ¼ 45 the initial position of the hindwing is shifted at various angles relative to the forewing ranging from 0 synchronised all the way up to 360 notice that at 360 we return to the initial synchronised case of 0 phase shift figure 9 shows the average lift force over a ﬂapping cycle as the function of the phase shift it also shows the standard deviation of the lift force over the same cycle the number of the bound vortices used in all the cases in this paper is m ¼ 10 the results have been conﬁrmed by calculations using m ¼ 15 notice that the average lift force peaks at around 110 phase shift but remains near the peak level for phase shift angle between 0 and 180 for the european journal of computational mechanics 19 figure 9 the average lift force fy and the standard deviation sd over the cycle as the function of the phase shift phase shift larger than 180 the lift force drops a little with the minimum lift force at around 300 while the average lift force remains practically constant for all the phase shift angles the standard deviation over the cycle varies drastically the standard deviation takes the maximum value at 0 and near 360 phase shift and minimum at about 180 phase shift the standard deviation indicates the stability of the ﬂight the smaller the standard deviation the stabler the ﬂight therefore taking into account the relatively constant average lift force over the cycle the 180 phase shit with its minimum standard deviation provides the most stable ﬂight 102 power versus stability in insect ﬂight based on the results of the study of the phase shift eﬀects obtained above we are singling out two cases one is the synchronous ﬂapping phase shift 0 and another is the asynchronous ﬂapping phase shift 180 of the twowing problem we now investigate the variation of the lift force over the ﬂapping cycle for each case figure 10 shows the variation of the lift force for the synchronous ﬂapping in contrast figure 11 shows the lift force variation for the asynchronous ﬂapping 20 m denda et al figure 10 lift force variation for the synchronous ﬂapping figure 11 lift force variation for the asynchronous ﬂapping phase shift 180 european journal of computational mechanics 21 although the average lift force over the cycle may be comparable for the asynchronous and synchronous ﬂapping cases their variations over the cycle are drastically diﬀerent the value of the lift force for the asynchronous ﬂapping remains positive throughout the cycle in comparison the synchronous ﬂapping provides larger lift force than the asynchronous case in the downstroke however it suﬀers the severe loss of the lift force in the upstroke figure 12 shows the wake vortex distribution for the synchronous ﬂapping at a moment of low lift force generation step 50 in figure 10 the corresponding velocity ﬁeld is shown in figure 13 figure 14 shows the wake vortex distribution at a low lift generation step 60 in figure 11 for the asynchronous ﬂapping the corresponding velocity ﬁeld is given by figure 15 the comparison of the wake vortex distribution plot and the velocity ﬁeld plot demonstrates the diﬀerence of the two presentations in the wake vortex distribution plot we can identify the pressure distribution in the air by looking at the population of the vortices around the wings according to the bernoulli equation the pressure is low where the velocity is high therefore if one side of a wing is populated by vortices and the other side is not the pressure on the side with more vortices is lower than the other side and the force acts on the wing from the highpressure to lowpressure side by looking at the wake vortex distribution plot we can visualise the force acting on the wings meanwhile the velocity ﬁeld plot does not provide the insight on the force acting on the wings but can be used to compare the results obtained with other methods figure 12 wake vortex distribution for the synchronous ﬂapping at a low lift generation step the circle and cross represent vortices from the fore and hindwings

distribution for the asynchronous ﬂapping at a low lift generation step the circle and cross represent vortices from the fore and hindwings respectively european journal of computational mechanics 23 figure 15 velocity distribution for the asynchronous ﬂapping at a low lift generation step corresponding to the wake vortex distribution of figure 14 notice that for the synchronous ﬂapping the hindwing is in the middle of the cloud of wake vortices resulting in low negative lift force in comparison the hindwing for the asynchronous ﬂapping stays away from the wake vortices generated by the forewing avoiding the severe loss of lift force overall the asynchronous ﬂapping provides the stable ﬂight at the loss of the lift while the synchronous ﬂapping provides more instant power at the expense of the stability of the ﬂight image sequences of the wake development for the two cases for the entire cycle of one period are provided by movie 1 synchronous and movie 2 asynchronous we have also provided three highspeed movies of dragonﬂy ﬂight during the regular ﬂight dragonﬂies ﬂy using asynchronous ﬂapping to achieve the stable level ﬂight as shown in movie 3 they also use the asynchronous ﬂapping during the natural takeoﬀ as shown in movie 4 but when threatened they ﬂap wings synchronously to gain the power to escape quickly as shown in movie 5 youtube links for the movies

twowing versus united singlewing ﬂight the following ﬁnal analysis is motivated by a feeble ﬂight of neuroptera lacewing mantidﬂy and antlion whose hingwings experience the diﬃculty in comparison to dragonﬂies in the context of our phase shift analysis the phase shift of the dragonﬂies is at around 180 while that of the neuroptera is around 0 which is synchronous ﬂapping indeed the neuroptera species ﬂap their wings synchronously resulting in feeble and vertically oscillating ﬂight this is explained by our earlier results for the synchronous ﬂapping but what happens if the two wings or two pairs of 3d wings are combined into a larger single wing one pair of 3d wings does the combined larger wing yield improved performance the ﬁrst analysis has been performed using the twowing programme with the synchronous ﬂapping as introduced earlier in which the eﬀects of the separation distance between the two wings are observed the parameters used are the same as before except the separation distance which is deﬁned as the sum bs ¼ bf þ bh of the separation distances of the fore and as shown in figure 2 at hindwings measured from the mass centre c a large separation distance the two wings ﬂap independently without interaction the lift calculated is 290 dyncm which remains constant as separation increases as bs is decreased the wings begin to interact and the lift force increases up to a peak value of 320 dyncm then the lift force suddenly drops to 260 dyncm as two wings get extremely close notice that the dropped value is smaller than the lift force achieved by a large separation indicating the destructive interaction of the wings this is in contrast to the constructive interaction observed at a moderate separation distance in which the lift force is greater than the force generated by a large separation in the second analysis for the single wing all parameters are kept the same as the twowing case except the chord length is doubled indicating the unity or linking of the two wings the maximum lift force in the downstroke is 225 dyncm as shown in figure 16 in all the cases considered the maximum lift force is observed during the downstroke at about the same time in the ﬂapping cycle the shape of the lift force curves remains almost identical for both the twowing and the singlewing cases although we have been expecting the combined singlewing to produce more lift force than the twowing synchronous ﬂapping it is not the case this means that the two wings ﬂapping independently but synchronously will produce more lift force than the single wing with the same surface area as the two wings combined additionally if the separation distance is properly adjusted then the synchronous twowing ﬂapping can achieve the constructive interaction between the two wings to maximise the lift force finally whether wings are united or remain separated as long as the wings move synchronously stability is lost and insects cannot achieve the level ﬂight european journal of computational mechanics 25 figure 16 lift force variation for the united fore and hindwing ﬂapping 11 concluding remarks we have developed a simple but eﬃcient numerical technique for the analysis of the ﬂapping with two pairs of wings in 2d using the vortex method using this technique we have performed a preliminary study on the eﬀects of two pairs of wings in insect ﬂapping ﬂight dragonﬂies manage to adopt two strategies in their ﬂight regularly they use the asynchronous ﬂapping for stability but occasionally they adopt the synchronous ﬂapping for power they can do this because they keep the two pairs of wings separated the majority of the other insects unite their fore and hindwings to provide more lift force in the downstroke however ﬂapping two pairs of wings synchronously seems to produce more lift force than ﬂapping with one pair of larger wings obtained by combining the two disclosure statement no potential conﬂict of interest was reported by the authors 26 m denda et al
