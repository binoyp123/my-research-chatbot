development of vortices in airplane insect flight hollander 2000 biomechanics of swimming airplane flight effect of the circulation flow around the wing a wing will experience an upward lift force when the average air pressure above the wing is lower that the pressure under the wing according to bernoullis principleinverse relationship between pressure and velocity this is the case when the average air velocity at the upper surface of the wing is higher than that beneath the wing the total airflow around the wing may be decomposed in a circulating flow around the wing with velocity v and a uniform flow at velocity u passing the wing figure 10 the velocity of the air above the wing will be u v and beneath it u v the pressure difference is then approximated by this pressure difference acting across a wing of area ap gives a liftforce of the circulating flow around the wing is called a bound vortex 72 see figure 10 the strength or circulation of the bound vortex is proportional to v development of circulation circulation and lift are constant for a wing moving at a constant speed steady state however when the wing accelerates impulsively from rest to a certain speed the circulation needs time to build up at the start of the motion air swirls around the trailing edge and vortices are shed into the wake figure 10 this build up of the socalled starting vortex will continue until a constant circulation is reached during this period the bound vortex will develop to the final steady state value this gradual buildup of the bound vortex is called the wagner effect even after 6 chord lengths of travel the circulation and lift are only 90 of the final values 72 history of vortex generation it is a fundamental rule of fluid dynamics that no vortex can be created unless a vortex of the opposite sense and strength is set up simultaneously kelvins circulation theorem thus the starting vortex is equal in magnitude but opposite in sense of rotation to the bound vortex tip vortices join up the starting and bound vortices they are created as air swirls around the tips from the higher pressure zone below the wing to the lower pressure zone above thus the accelerating wing generates a vortex ring enclosing air that has been blown downwards when the wing motion stops the bound vortex then swirls off the trailing edge and forms the stopping vortex closing the vortex ring which subsequently moves downward into the wake insect flapping flight vortex generation during a periodic propulsion whether the air flow associated with insect flight propulsion is unsteady or quasisteady the reaction force to the lift must impact momentum to the fluid with a periodic propulsion as in insect flight and swimming the formation of start tip and stop vortices is unavoidable as argued above this may well result in a vortex ring left behind in the wake during each halfstroke the lift coefficient of a wing is generally roughly proportional to the angle of attack up to a certain limit the limit is due to the phenomenon called stalling and the angle of attack at which stalling occurs is known as the stalling angle when the angle of attack is less than the stalling angle the flow is attached to the surface of the wing when it is greater than the stalling angle the flow separates from the upper surface of the wing and large eddies form leading to a sudden drop in lift force vortex generation during a periodic propulsion it was shown that the lift forces needed to support the weight of insects during hovering is greater than the peak lift forces the wing can generate before it stalls in steady motion 72 the problem is even worse because the quasisteady analysis ignores past history and therefore the wagner effect circulation and lift will not grow to steadystate values on each half stroke because the wing moves only 34 chord lengths during hovering thus the quasisteady estimate of lift is overly optimistic and the discrepancy with actual forces produced is even greater as observed above this crisis forced insect flight researchers to look for unsteady liftenhancing mechanisms several mechanisms have been proposed see for a review 72 unsteady liftenhancing mechanisms in insect flight clap and fling mechanism weisfogh 76 proposed two novel mechanisms of lift generation that explained the flight mechanism for certain groups of insects the lift produced by these mechanisms depends on events during the rotational phases pronation and supination at either end of the wingbeat when the wing rapidly rotates about its long axis through about 120 in preparation for the next half stroke it is hardly surprising that these mechanisms were new to aerodynamics conventional wings are never operated in this extreme manner 72 unsteady liftenhancing mechanisms in insect flight delayed stall or dynamic stall we have seen that if the angle of attack is slowly increased to values above the stalling angle separation of flow from the wing surface occurs however if the angle of attack is suddenly increased above the stall angle or if the wing is accelerated quickly with a high angle of attack separation of flow is delayed and the wing may move for several chords generating lift that exceeds the maximum steadystate value the growth of lift beyond the values observed during steady state are associated with the formation of a leadingedge vortex figure 11 unsteady liftenhancing mechanisms in insect flight delayed stall or dynamic stall the leading edge vortex is formed when the flow separates from the wing at the onset of stalling as long as the leading edge vortex is above the wing circulation around the wing is enhanced leading to significantly increased lift forces however the problem with accelerating wings in translation is that the leading edge vortex breaks away rather quickly within 2 chords of travel and lift will reduce sharply in other words the leading edge vortex is rather unstable recently the airflow around flapping wings was visualized using smoke released from the leading edge of a scaledup robotic model of a hawkmoth analysis showed that a strong leadingedge vortex was present during the down stroke which was stabilized by a strong axial flow ie from wing base to wing tip 77 thus in a flapping wing which rotates around the shoulder the leading edge vortex was stable enough to remain attached along the wing until approximately three quarters of the wing length during most of the downstroke unsteady liftenhancing mechanisms in insect flight delayed stall or dynamic stall at the tip it separates and blends into a wide tangled tip vortex the leading edge vortex is stabilized by a strong axial flow originating from a pressure differential that is caused by the velocity gradient between wing base and wing tip the tip moves faster than the base the velocity gradient is due to the rotation of the wing about its shoulder joint such that the up and down velocity at the base is small but increases towards the tip the extra lift force generated by this vortex alone was sufficient to carry 23 of the hawkmoths weight while the impulse of the two ring vortices left in the wake corresponded to about 15 times its body weight 78 79 this new liftenhancing mechanism seems promising to explain the high liftforces produced by a range of insects it also showed that the conventional quasisteady approach failed for two reasons 1 dynamic stall cannot occur in quasi steady conditions and 2 the axial flow component which turned out to be large and crucial for stability of the vortex is ignored in the 2d quasisteady approach a similar leadingedge vortex with strong axial flow is observed in deltawinged airplanes and is responsible for the high lift forces generated
