python manual for tombopy v1 by isaiah pajaro 2292024 this manual will skip over a lot of things ie environments git etc for the sake of simplicity for inexperienced people with that said this manual is broken down into 3 major sections 1 installing the prerequisites 2 setting up the prerequisites 3 running the code for now i am writing this manual for windows users i can write up one for ubuntu but i am assuming if you are using ubuntulinux you can install and setup the prerequisites on your own if so you can clonedownload the code and follow the readme for everyone else lets get started installing prerequisites we will need python a way to run python code sometimes known as an editoride this tutorial will use vscode the code itself installing python search python download in your web browser it should take you to the download page from the official pythonorg website alternatively click here there you will see the latest version for download not the prerelease version at the time of writing this is python 3122 click the download button and run the downloaded file you should get the following window upon running it here just make sure to check the bottom 2 boxes then select install now once complete we can verify that it installed correctly to do this open the windows search by clicking the windows logo windows 10 has it located bottom left windows 11 has it located bottom middle then from here type cmd it should open a search bar and start typing automatically we are looking to open a command prompt once open type python version you should get an output giving the version we installed which is python 3122 if this does not work you may need to try python3 version if that does not work try running the installer we downloaded earlier once more installing a python editoride theres many different editorsides available for this tutorial we will use vscode search vscode download in your web browser it should take you to the download page from the official codevisualstudiocom website alternatively click here click the download button for windows and run the downloaded file the default install options should be good just need to accept the terms and conditions and make sure it is added to path once complete you can uncheck launch vs code now we can move onto getting the code downloading the code navigate to the github or click here in the top right you should see a green code button in this menu we want to download zip save this zip file somewhere you can navigate to dont worry too much about organization as we will be deleting this zip file later now its time to extract the files from this zip folder just double click the zip file at it should open a new file explorer window if not right click it and open with file explorer now we need to extract this folder click the pink extract tab at the top then in this new menu select extract all and select a place to save the files i would put it somewhere convenient as this folder will be accessed a lot and we will be keeping it unlike the zip file which you can delete after this step perfect now you have everything needed now its time to combine them together setting up the prerequisites we will need python extensions opening code itself python packages setting up python extensions open up vscode you can search for it the same way we did with cmd previously you may be greeted with a tutorial you can skip it or go through it then come back here now its time to install the python extension click the extension manager on the left side the button looks like 4 building blocks then search for python and install the official python extension from microsoft then reload vscode by pressing the reload required button or open and close vscode setting up the code folder vscode should restart and now that were back in vscode its time to open the code folder in the top right select file open folder then navigate to the root code folder note it will be a nested folder inside the extracted folder we want the root folder to only have src and tests upon selection we want to work in the root folder so this is not correct this is correct notice that we are inside the tombopymain folder which is nested in a folder with the same name sorry its confusing setting up the python packages we need to open up the terminal this is equivalent to the command window in matlab to do this select terminal in the top left and select new terminal a new subpanel will appear at the bottom of vscode with the terminal here type pip install r requirementstxt it will install a bunch of things after its done you should have control of the terminal again now type python m build it will build the code into a simple package called tombo after its done you should have control of the terminal again now type pip install editable test it will install the code package tombo we just made now thats its done its time to run the code running the code in the terminal run tombo simplot we need to do this once to cache the functions this will allow us to have subsequent runs be much faster you will know its done once you get control of the terminal now that the code is done running you can check the plots under the outputplot folder if you want to edit the simulation parameters just open the configtoml file and edit what you want then in the terminal run tombo simplot to run the simluation with the new configuration you can open the readmemd file located in folder with the configtoml file for more information and other commands heres a quick list sim run the simulation and save the data plot convert the simulation data into a png file need to run sim first so theres data to convert simplot run sim then plot view open the simulation data in an interactive viewer like in matlab
